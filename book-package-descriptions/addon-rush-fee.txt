Need it fast? The Rush Fee adds priority 48-hour turnaround to any package. Your project jumps to the front of the production queue and receives dedicated, uninterrupted focus to meet the accelerated timeline.

Available as an add-on to any package — ebook covers, series branding, children's books, or full pipeline orders. The rush fee is 50% of the base package price. All deliverables, quality standards, and revision rounds remain identical to the original package — only the timeline changes.
