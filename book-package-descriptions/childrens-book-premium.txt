Premium 32-page illustrated children's picture book with a custom character design system and complete print package. Includes original story writing or adaptation with enhanced narrative structure, vocabulary calibration, and pedagogical consideration for your target age group.

Every page receives a full-color illustration with multiple refinement passes to ensure the highest visual standard. A dedicated character design system is created before page production begins — front view, side view, expressions, and clothing defined as a reusable reference system. This guarantees flawless character consistency across every page and any future books in the series.

Formatted to exact Amazon KDP Print specifications — proper bleed, margins, gutter allowance, and color profile (CMYK-safe) for KDP Print Paperback and Hardcover. Delivered as a complete print-ready PDF with all pages, front cover, title page, copyright page, and back cover assembled in correct order.

All 32 illustrations plus cover art are also delivered as separate high-resolution files for marketing, social media, or alternative layouts. A separate story text document provides the complete story page-by-page — useful for audio narration, translation, or future adaptations.
