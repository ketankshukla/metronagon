Complete branding package includes series logo, panoramic cover, author portrait, YouTube thumbnail, and a comprehensive style guide documenting every visual decision. Box set cover, wide-format panoramic scene connecting all major elements, and branded social media thumbnail are all included.

A series bible documents world rules, magic systems, geography, timeline, character backstories, and all established canon. Full character tracking provides descriptions, relationship maps, knowledge states, power progressions, and emotional arcs across all books.

Two full revision rounds across every deliverable — covers, plans, branding, bible, descriptions, and continuity documents. 10-day delivery.
