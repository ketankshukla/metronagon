Complete 32-page illustrated children's picture book for digital distribution. Includes original story writing or adaptation of your concept into a picture-book-friendly structure with age-appropriate language and pacing.

Every page receives a full-color illustration using a consistent art style — Pixar/Disney-inspired aesthetic or your preferred direction. Main characters maintain the same appearance, proportions, and clothing across all 32 pages using style anchoring and reference sheets, ensuring visual consistency from cover to cover.

Delivered as a complete page-ordered PDF with illustrations and text laid out together — ready for digital distribution or print submission. All 32 page illustrations are also delivered as separate high-resolution image files for flexible use in layouts, marketing, or social media.

One revision round covers adjustments to illustrations, text placement, character expressions, or scene composition on any pages that need refinement. 5-day delivery.
