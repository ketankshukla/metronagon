32-page illustrated children's picture book — illustration only, you provide the story text. Every page receives a full-color illustration using a consistent art style — Pixar/Disney-inspired aesthetic or your preferred direction. Main characters maintain the same appearance, proportions, and clothing across all 32 pages using style anchoring.

Includes a front cover illustration for your children's book — does not include spine or back cover. Delivered as a complete page-ordered PDF with illustrations and text laid out together, ready for digital distribution. All 32 page illustrations also delivered as separate high-resolution image files.

One revision round for adjustments to illustrations, text placement, character expressions, or scene composition. 2-day delivery.
