A quarterly retainer for authors who publish regularly. For $150 per quarter, you lock in new covers at just $50 each — up to 1 new cover per month. Your series style files are kept on file, so every new cover matches the existing visual identity perfectly with zero onboarding time.

Ideal for prolific authors expanding an ongoing series, rapid-release publishers, or anyone who wants consistent, affordable cover production on a predictable schedule. Each cover is delivered at 1600×2400, 300 DPI, Amazon KDP-ready, built from your established style guide.
