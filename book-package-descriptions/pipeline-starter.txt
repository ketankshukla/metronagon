Complete publishing pipeline for a 3-book series — planning, covers, branding, and marketing copy in one package. Includes a full series plan with complete series arc, chapter outlines for all 3 books, and cross-book continuity planning — the architectural foundation for your series.

Three visually consistent ebook covers are built from a shared style guide, each at 1600×2400, 300 DPI, Amazon KDP-ready. A custom series logo — logomark and wordmark — anchors the visual identity across all books.

A landscape box set cover showcases all 3 books as a single product for Amazon box set listings. Keyword-optimized Amazon descriptions for all 3 books provide compelling hooks that drive conversions while maintaining series continuity.

One revision round covers adjustments to any deliverable — covers, plan structure, descriptions, or branding elements. 5-day delivery.
