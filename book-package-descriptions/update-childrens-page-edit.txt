Text or story edits with a re-illustrated page in your existing children's book. Each page is updated with your requested text or story changes and the illustration is regenerated to match — maintaining consistent character design, art style, and visual quality with the rest of the book.

Delivered as updated high-resolution image files and an updated assembled PDF. Ideal for correcting text, adjusting story flow, or refining illustrations after reader feedback. Priced per page. 1 day per page.
