Reorder, split, or merge books within your existing series plan. Your series architecture is reorganized — whether that means splitting one book into two, merging two into one, reordering the sequence for better narrative flow, or restructuring chapter outlines to accommodate a new direction.

All continuity documents, subplot tracking, and character arcs are updated to reflect the restructured plan. Ideal when the series direction has evolved, reader feedback suggests a different structure, or your publishing strategy has shifted. 3-day delivery.
