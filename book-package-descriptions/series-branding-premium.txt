Complete visual identity package for an epic-scale series of 8 or more books. Includes a premium series logo — logomark and wordmark anchoring the visual identity across every book in the series.

Every book receives a cover built from the same style guide — whether it's 8, 10, or 12 books, every cover looks like it belongs. All covers delivered at 1600×2400, 300 DPI, Amazon KDP-ready.

A landscape box set cover showcases the complete collection on Amazon. A wide-format panoramic scene connects all major characters or elements — ideal for marketing banners, website heroes, and print posters. A branded 1280×720 YouTube/social media thumbnail is optimized for promotion and advertising campaigns.

A professional author portrait rendered in the series' visual style is included for author pages, social profiles, and book back matter.

A comprehensive style guide documents every visual decision: colors, fonts, composition rules, visual guidelines, character descriptions, and expansion guidelines for maintaining consistency as the series grows. 7-day delivery.
