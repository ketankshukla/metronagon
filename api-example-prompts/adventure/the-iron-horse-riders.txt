---

A cinematic Western book cover composed in the iconic split-composition style of classic Spaghetti Western movie posters — the top portion dominated by an extreme close-up of a rider's eyes beneath a hat brim, the bottom portion opening into a vast, epic desert landscape with distant riders. The composition creates two simultaneous scales: the intimate, tense human scale of watchful eyes, and the epic, sweeping scale of the American frontier. The color grade is pure Western: warm, dusty, golden, with deep dramatic shadows.

THE EYES (top portion, 5-35% from top):

An extreme close-up of a person's eyes and the bridge of their nose — just the eye area visible beneath the shadow of a wide hat brim. This is the classic Leone framing: so close that the eyes fill the width of the image, each eye approximately 15% of the image width.

THE HAT BRIM: A dark, weathered felt hat brim (#2A1A10) cuts across the very top of the image, casting a deep shadow over the upper face. The brim's edge is slightly worn and dusty.

THE EYES: Dark, intense, watchful — the eyes of someone scanning a vast horizon for danger. The irises are warm brown (#6A4A20) with golden-amber (#C8A040) flecks visible in the dramatic side-lighting. The whites are not perfectly white — they are the slightly bloodshot, dust-irritated whites of someone who has been riding through desert for days. Fine crow's-feet wrinkles radiate from the outer corners — sun damage, squinting, age. The eyebrows are dark, straight, dusted with fine red-brown desert dust.

THE SKIN: Weathered, sun-darkened, with the specific texture of skin exposed to years of wind and UV — visible pores, fine lines, the warm, leathery quality of outdoor aging. The skin tone is deep warm brown (#8B6040) — whether from heritage or sun exposure is deliberately ambiguous. The lighting is dramatic side-light from the right, creating a bright highlight on the right cheekbone and nose bridge, and deep shadow on the left side.

THE DUST: A fine film of reddish desert dust covers the visible skin — particularly along the hat brim shadow line and in the creases around the eyes. The dust is the same red-brown as the landscape below, visually connecting the person to the land.

THE LANDSCAPE (bottom portion, 40-95% from top):

Below the close-up face, the composition opens dramatically into a vast Western landscape — the shift from intimate to epic is the cover's most powerful visual move.

DESERT VALLEY: A wide, flat desert valley stretching to distant mesas and buttes on the horizon. The terrain is classic American Southwest: red-brown earth (#A06030), scattered sage brush rendered as small, grey-green dots, and the characteristic flat-topped mesa formations in the distance (#8B6A50) that define the Western genre's visual identity. The valley floor has the cracked, dry texture of parched earth.

THE RIDERS: In the middle distance (approximately 65% from top), a line of five riders on horseback — small figures against the vast landscape, riding in a loose formation from right to left. Each rider is a dark silhouette against the bright desert floor, their horses kicking up small dust clouds. The lead rider sits tall in the saddle; the others follow at intervals. The riders are small enough to emphasize the landscape's scale but large enough to be clearly identifiable as mounted figures.

DUST: A long, low cloud of dust trails behind the riders — warm, golden, backlit by the sun. The dust cloud catches the late afternoon light and GLOWS — a luminous, amber haze (#E8C070 at low opacity) that connects the riders to the landscape, making their passage visible across miles.

RAILROAD TRACKS: Running diagonally across the lower portion of the image (75-90% from top), a set of railroad tracks — twin lines of iron on wooden ties, stretching from the lower-left toward the vanishing point in the upper-right distance. The tracks are the "iron horse" of the title — the railroad that is changing the West. The iron rails catch the sun as bright, thin highlights against the dark wood ties and red-brown earth.

THE SKY (visible between the eyes and the landscape, 35-45% from top):

A dramatic Western sky — the transition zone between the close-up and the landscape. The sky is enormous, taking up significant visual space:
- Deep, warm amber-gold (#FFD080) near the horizon — the intense golden light of late afternoon in the desert
- Transitioning to deeper warm blue (#3A5A8B) higher up
- Dramatic cloud formations — not storm clouds but high, sweeping cirrus and scattered cumulus in warm gold and deep purple-grey, backlit by the setting sun
- The sun itself is low and to the right, not directly visible but its position indicated by the directional lighting on everything in the scene

CINEMATIC COLOR GRADE:

The entire image has a deliberate Western color grade:
- Highlights shifted toward warm amber (#FFD080)
- Shadows deepened and shifted toward warm brown (#2A1A10)
- Mid-tones warmed to dusty gold (#C8A060)
- Overall slight desaturation — colors are warm but not vivid, creating the dust-filtered quality of desert light
- Contrast is high but not harsh — deep shadows and bright highlights with limited mid-range

TEXT — WESTERN BOLD:

Title (positioned at 36-42% from top, in the sky zone between the eyes and landscape):
"THE IRON HORSE" — in a bold, condensed slab-serif font (think Clarendon, Rockwell, or a Western display face — the fonts of "WANTED" posters and frontier signage) in warm dusty gold (#E8C070). Large, letter-spacing 0.1em. The slab-serif font is the typographic signature of the Western genre.
"RIDERS" — on the next line, same font, LARGER, in dark shadow brown (#2A1A10). The gold-to-dark shift mirrors the transition from bright sky to dark landscape.

Subtitle (positioned at 44% from top): "A Western Adventure" — in small slab-serif in warm amber (#C8A060), letter-spacing 0.2em.

Author name (positioned at 92-95% from top, along the railroad tracks): "MARSHAL COLE ASHWORTH-OKAFOR" — in slab-serif in dusty gold (#E8C070), letter-spacing 0.15em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Tense, epic, sun-baked — the feeling of watching riders approach across a desert from a distance so great that the heat haze shimmers between you. The split composition creates dual tension: the intimate tension of watchful eyes (who are they watching? what did they see?) and the epic tension of riders crossing a vast, hostile landscape. The Western visual language — the golden light, the mesa silhouettes, the railroad tracks, the dust — is instantly recognizable and deeply evocative.

THIS IS SPAGHETTI WESTERN CINEMATOGRAPHY. Extreme close-up meets epic panorama. The beauty is in the scale shift — from the pores on sun-weathered skin to the vanishing point of railroad tracks on the horizon, all in a single frame.
