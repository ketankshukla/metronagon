---

A soft, warm children's book cover where every element appears to be hand-crafted from sheets of colored felt fabric, sewn together with visible stitching. The entire scene has the tactile, cozy quality of a handmade quiet book or felt storyboard — the kind of craft project made with love by someone who understands that children respond to texture and warmth. Every surface shows the characteristic fuzzy nap of craft felt, every edge is defined by visible blanket-stitch or running-stitch embroidery thread, and decorative details are rendered as buttons, beads, and embroidered accents.

THE SCENE — A FOREST OF FELT TREES WITH A UNIQUE LITTLE FOX:

A charming forest scene where felt trees, felt flowers, and felt woodland animals create a world of soft, tactile beauty. The forest is friendly and welcoming — no scary shadows, no dark corners.

THE FELT TREES (filling sides and upper portion, 10-75% from top):

Five or six trees fill the scene, each one constructed from felt pieces:
- TRUNKS: Rectangles of brown felt (#6B4226) with visible wood-grain texture suggested by lines of darker brown embroidery thread stitched vertically. The trunk edges are defined by visible blanket-stitch in cream thread.
- CANOPIES: Large, rounded shapes cut from different shades of green felt — emerald (#2E8B57), sage (#70A070), lime (#90C050) — each canopy a slightly different shape (round, oval, cloud-shaped) and a slightly different green, emphasizing that no two trees are alike. The canopy edges have visible blanket-stitch in a contrasting thread color. Some canopies have small BUTTON accents — actual button shapes (round, with 2 or 4 small holes in the center) in red, yellow, or orange, representing apples or autumn fruits.
- One tree has a small FELT BIRD on its branch — a simple bird shape cut from blue felt with a button eye and a tiny orange felt triangle beak, attached with visible stitching.

THE MAIN CHARACTER — FERN THE FOX (center, 45-80% from top):

A small fox character made entirely of felt:
- BODY: An oval of warm orange felt (#E07830) with the characteristic fuzzy felt texture visible across the entire surface. The body has a lighter cream felt (#FFF0D0) belly patch — a smaller oval sewn onto the body with visible running-stitch in cream thread.
- HEAD: A rounded triangle shape of orange felt, with two pointed ears (each ear an orange felt triangle with a smaller pink felt triangle sewn inside). Large BUTTON EYES — two round black buttons (with visible thread X-stitches through the holes, attaching them to the felt). A small black embroidered nose (a tiny triangle of satin stitch). A small embroidered smile in dark brown thread.
- TAIL: A large, bushy tail shape cut from orange felt with a white felt tip — the tail is oversized and flowing, the fox's most distinctive feature.
- LEGS: Four simple cylindrical shapes of orange felt.
- WHAT MAKES FERN DIFFERENT: Fern is NOT orange like a normal fox — Fern is PURPLE. A deep, warm purple (#7040A0) felt body instead of the expected orange. Fern's purple color is the story's theme: being different. But the purple is beautiful — rich, warm, and perfectly Fern. All the other design elements (cream belly, button eyes, embroidered smile) are the same as a "normal" felt fox — only the color is different.

Fern sits in the center of the forest, looking up at the viewer with button eyes that somehow communicate warmth and gentle uncertainty — the expression of someone who knows they're different and is learning that different is wonderful.

THE OTHER FELT ANIMALS (surrounding Fern):

Small felt woodland animals are scattered through the scene, each one a simple sewn shape:
- A BROWN FELT RABBIT with long ears and a cotton-ball tail (a small white pompom)
- A GREEN FELT FROG on a brown felt log, with googly-style button eyes
- A YELLOW FELT BUTTERFLY with symmetrical wings and a tiny bead body, connected to a felt flower by a curving line of embroidery thread (suggesting flight)
- A RED FELT LADYBUG on a leaf, with black button spots

These animals are all looking at Fern — not with hostility but with curiosity and the beginnings of friendship. Their body angles lean toward Fern, creating a sense of community forming.

THE FOREST FLOOR:

Green felt ground with felt flowers:
- Each flower is a simple felt construction: a circle of colored felt (pink #FF80A0, yellow #FFD040, blue #6080C0) with a button center, on a green felt stem with simple leaf shapes
- Small felt mushrooms with red felt caps and white felt spots (small circles sewn on)
- The ground felt has visible texture — the fuzzy nap of craft felt, slightly uneven, warm and soft

FELT TECHNIQUE — MUST LOOK HANDMADE:

- VISIBLE STITCHING: Every edge of every felt piece shows visible embroidery stitching — blanket stitch for edges, running stitch for decoration, satin stitch for small details (noses, small shapes). The thread colors contrast with the felt colors: cream thread on dark felt, dark thread on light felt.
- FELT TEXTURE: The characteristic soft, fuzzy, slightly fibrous surface of craft felt is visible on every piece — not smooth like paper or fabric, but with the subtle nap and pill-texture of pressed wool or synthetic felt.
- BUTTON DETAILS: Buttons are used as eyes (for characters), fruit (on trees), and decorative centers (for flowers). Each button is rendered with realistic detail: the slight dome shape, the holes, the thread that attaches it.
- LAYERED CONSTRUCTION: Elements overlap as in real felt craft — the tree canopy overlaps the trunk, the fox's belly patch sits ON TOP of the body, flowers sit ON TOP of the ground. Each layer has a tiny shadow beneath its edge.
- EMBROIDERY ACCENTS: Decorative embroidery appears as details: swirl patterns on the sky felt, grass texture as green straight stitches, star shapes stitched in yellow thread.

TEXT — EMBROIDERED AND SEWN:

Title (positioned at 4-20% from top, centered on sky blue felt):
"THE FELT" — rendered as though EMBROIDERED onto the sky-blue felt background in chain stitch or backstitch — the letters are made of visible embroidery stitching in warm brown thread (#6B4226). The stitched quality means letters have slightly uneven edges and visible individual stitch marks. Medium-large.
"FOREST" — on the next line, same embroidered technique, LARGER, in deep green thread (#2E8B57). Each letter is clearly composed of individual stitches.

Subtitle (positioned at 22% from top, centered): "A Story About Being Different" — embroidered in smaller stitching in purple thread (#7040A0) — Fern's color, connecting the subtitle to the character's theme.

Author/Illustrator (positioned at 88-92% from top): "by IRIS NAKAMURA-OSEI" — embroidered in small brown stitching.

OVERALL MOOD:

Soft, warm, accepting — the feeling of being wrapped in something handmade, something made with love specifically for YOU. The felt aesthetic is inherently comforting — felt is soft, felt is safe, felt is the material of children's craft and quiet play. Fern's purple color against the warm orange, green, and brown of the forest is a gentle visual metaphor: different stands out, and standing out is beautiful.

THIS IS FELT AND FABRIC CRAFT ILLUSTRATION. Soft, stitched, tactile. Visible felt texture, visible embroidery thread, button eyes. The beauty is in the handmade quality — every stitch placed with intention, every button attached with care, every felt piece cut and arranged to create a world that is soft, safe, and welcoming.
