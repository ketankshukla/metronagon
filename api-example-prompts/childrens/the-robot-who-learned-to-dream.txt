---

A heartwarming children's book cover featuring a single adorable robot character rendered in the style of a major animation studio's character art — the kind of polished, expressive 3D rendering seen in the best animated films. The robot is the entire focus: a loveable, slightly clumsy, deeply endearing character that children will want to hug. The scene is intimate — a child's bedroom at night, lit by a single warm nightlight, with the robot experiencing something new and wonderful: a dream.

THE ROBOT — BLINK (center, 35-85% from top):

Blink is a small, round, decidedly NON-threatening robot designed with every principle of cute character design:

BODY: A rounded, egg-shaped body approximately the size of a large cat — smooth, slightly dented brushed aluminum with a warm silver-blue tone (#A0B0C0). The body is not sleek and perfect — it has the loveable imperfection of a well-used toy: small scratches, a tiny dent on the left side, and a patch where a different-colored metal panel has been riveted on as a repair (warm copper-gold, #C09050). The body has a subtle subsurface scattering quality — the metal is thin enough in places that the warm internal glow of Blink's power source shows through as a faint amber warmth from within.

HEAD: A slightly smaller rounded shape sitting atop the body with no visible neck — the head rotates and tilts via an internal mechanism. The head is the same brushed aluminum as the body. On the front of the head, TWO ENORMOUS EYES — Blink's primary expressive feature. The eyes are large, round camera-lens-style optics with glowing iris rings: the outer ring is soft blue (#60A0E0), the inner ring is warm amber (#FFB040), and the pupil is a deep, dark circle that reflects the bedroom scene in miniature. The eyes are currently half-closed — heavy-lidded with sleepiness, the iris rings dimmed to a gentle glow. The eyelids are thin metal shutters that close from top and bottom, and they are rendered at the drowsy halfway point. A small antenna protrudes from the top of the head — a thin, flexible wire with a tiny glowing blue ball at the tip, currently drooping to one side like a sleepy flower.

ARMS: Two thin, articulated arms extend from the body's sides — simple mechanical arms with ball-joint shoulders, hinged elbows, and three-fingered hands (two fingers and a thumb, each a rounded cylinder). The arms are currently hugging a small stuffed teddy bear to Blink's chest — the teddy is soft, worn, brown, and clearly beloved. The mechanical fingers grip the teddy with surprising gentleness.

LEGS: Two short, stumpy legs ending in flat, round feet — like small suction cups. Blink is sitting on a child's bed, legs dangling over the edge, feet not touching the floor.

EXPRESSION: Despite having no mouth, Blink communicates PURE SLEEPY CONTENTMENT through eye shape (half-closed, heavy), antenna position (drooping), body posture (slightly slumped, hugging teddy), and the warm dimmed glow of the eye-rings. The character design follows the animation principle that eyes and body language communicate emotion more powerfully than mouths.

THE DREAM EFFECT — THE MAGICAL ELEMENT:

Above Blink's head, a soft, luminous cloud of dream imagery is forming — Blink's first dream, made visible. The dream cloud is rendered as a translucent, softly glowing bubble approximately 25% of the image width, hovering above the antenna. Inside the dream cloud, small, simple, dreamlike images are faintly visible:
- A tiny field of flowers in soft watercolor style (not 3D — deliberately different from the rest of the image, as dreams look different from reality)
- A small butterfly in warm gold
- Stars and a crescent moon
The dream cloud glows with a soft, warm light — pale lavender (#D0C0E0) and warm gold (#FFE080) — that illuminates Blink's head from above, adding a magical rim-light to the antenna and the top of the head.

THE BEDROOM:

A child's bedroom at night — warm, cozy, safe:
- The bed is simple, with a blue (#6080A0) duvet that is rumpled and soft, white pillows, and a patchwork quilt in warm colors (amber, coral, sky blue squares)
- A nightlight on the bedside table casts the scene's primary warm light — a small plug-in light shaped like a crescent moon, glowing warm amber (#FFD080)
- The walls are soft blue (#C0D0E0) with barely visible star-pattern wallpaper
- A bookshelf in the background holds a few children's books (colorful spines visible) and a few more stuffed animals
- A window shows a deep blue night sky (#1A2050) with a real crescent moon and stars outside — mirroring the dream moon above Blink's head
- Soft shadows fill the corners — not scary darkness but cozy, protective dimness

LIGHTING — WARM AND INTIMATE:

Two light sources create the scene's warmth:
1. The moon nightlight: Warm amber (#FFD080), casting soft directional light from the right, illuminating Blink's face, the teddy bear, and the bed surface. This light is warm, soft, and domestic.
2. The dream cloud: Pale lavender and gold glow from above, adding a magical quality to the upper portion of the scene. This light is ethereal, soft, and wonder-inducing.
The combination creates a warm, safe, slightly magical atmosphere — nighttime in a child's room, where the boundary between waking and dreaming is beautifully thin.

COLOR PALETTE — BEDTIME WARMTH:

- Brushed silver-blue: #A0B0C0 — Blink's body
- Warm amber: #FFD080 — nightlight, eye ring, internal glow
- Soft blue: #60A0E0 — eye ring, duvet, accents
- Deep night blue: #1A2050 — window sky, deep shadows
- Dream lavender: #D0C0E0 — dream cloud
- Dream gold: #FFE080 — dream cloud accents
- Warm copper: #C09050 — Blink's repair patch, warm accents
- Teddy brown: #8B6B4A — stuffed bear
- Soft wall blue: #C0D0E0 — bedroom walls

TEXT — SOFT, ROUNDED, CHILD-FRIENDLY:

Title (positioned at 4-24% from top, centered):
"The Robot Who" — in a soft, rounded sans-serif font (think Fredoka One, Baloo, or Quicksand Bold — the fonts that say "children's book" without being Comic Sans) in warm amber (#FFD080). Medium size, letter-spacing 0.1em.
"Learned to" — on the next line, same font, smaller, in soft blue (#60A0E0).
"DREAM" — on the next line, MUCH larger, in the same font but rendered with a special treatment: the letters are filled with a gradient from warm amber at the bottom to dream lavender at the top, with tiny star shapes scattered within the letters. The word "DREAM" is the visual event — it glows, it sparkles, it promises magic.

Subtitle (positioned at 26% from top, centered): "a bedtime story" — in small, gentle rounded sans-serif in soft blue (#60A0E0), letter-spacing 0.2em.

Author/Illustrator (positioned at 89-93% from top, centered): "written & illustrated by KUMI NAKAMURA-OSEI" — in small rounded sans-serif in warm amber (#FFD080).

OVERALL MOOD:

Tender, sleepy, magical — the feeling of a child's eyelids getting heavy while a parent reads the last page of a bedtime story. Blink is the perfect bedtime companion: gentle, warm, slightly imperfect, and discovering something wonderful for the first time. The 3D rendering quality makes Blink feel REAL — a character a child could believe exists, sitting on their own bed, learning to dream.

At thumbnail, the glowing robot eyes and the warm bedroom lighting against the dark blue night create an immediately appealing, warm image. At full resolution, Blink's character design — the gentle eye-lids, the drooping antenna, the tender grip on the teddy bear, the dream cloud above — is irresistible.

THIS IS PIXAR-QUALITY 3D CHARACTER ART. Polished, expressive, warm. The beauty is in the character design — a robot that communicates pure emotion through eye shape and body language, in a scene that makes bedtime feel like the beginning of an adventure.
