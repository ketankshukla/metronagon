---

A delightful children's book cover that looks like a photograph of an actual pop-up book standing open — a three-dimensional paper scene rising from the open pages of a book, with mountains, a sailing ship, and a treasure island all constructed from folded, cut, and engineered paper. The image has the physical dimensionality of a real pop-up: every element is clearly made of paper or card, with visible fold lines, cut edges, paper tabs, and the characteristic flat-but-3D quality of pop-up engineering. The "camera" is positioned at a slight angle above the open book, looking down at the pop-up scene from about 30 degrees.

THE OPEN BOOK (base, bottom 25% of image):

An open hardcover book lies on a warm wooden surface (a child's desk or table). The book's covers are spread flat, showing the inside covers in a warm blue (#3050A0) endpaper with a faded treasure map pattern printed on them. The book's pages are thick cream-white paper (#FFF8E0), and from the center fold (the gutter), the pop-up scene rises upward.

THE POP-UP SCENE (rising from the book, 20-80% from top):

A complete adventure landscape constructed from paper engineering:

THE OCEAN: The base level of the pop-up, lying flat on the book's pages — a sheet of paper printed/painted in ocean blue (#2080C0) with simple white wave patterns. The ocean paper has subtle fold lines visible where it creates small wave-like ridges — a paper engineering technique that adds dimensionality to flat surfaces.

THE ISLAND (center, rising from the ocean): A pop-up island constructed from multiple layers of folded card:
- The island base is a rough circle of green card (#30A050) rising approximately 2cm above the ocean level, held up by hidden paper tabs and folding mechanisms. The green card has printed textures suggesting grass and vegetation.
- On the island, a MOUNTAIN rises — a triangular fold of grey-brown card (#8B7B6A) with a white card snow cap (#FFFFFF) glued to its peak. The mountain has visible fold lines running from its peak to its base — the crisp, geometric creases of folded card. The mountain is approximately 40% of the total pop-up height.
- A PALM TREE stands on the island — constructed from a rolled paper trunk (thin brown card rolled into a cylinder) with green card palm fronds cut and folded to fan outward. The palm fronds have visible cut edges and fold lines.
- A TREASURE CHEST sits at the mountain's base — a tiny box constructed from gold card (#D4AF37), its lid propped open by a small paper tab, tiny paper jewels (small colored paper circles) visible inside.

THE SAILING SHIP (left side, on the ocean): A beautiful paper ship constructed with pop-up engineering:
- The hull is a folded piece of warm brown card (#6B4226) shaped into a boat form — visible fold lines along the keel, the sides held apart by internal paper struts
- Three masts rise from the hull — thin paper tubes or folded card strips
- Sails are pieces of white paper (#FFF8E0), slightly curved to suggest wind, attached to the masts with tiny paper tabs. One sail has a red paper cross (#E04040) glued to it. The sails have the slightly translucent quality of thin paper — the masts are faintly visible through them.
- A tiny paper flag flies from the tallest mast — a triangular piece of red paper
- The ship appears to be sailing toward the island, positioned so it rises from the left pages of the book

A SEA MONSTER (right side, emerging from the ocean): A playful, non-threatening paper sea serpent — its body made from a series of curved paper arcs that rise and dip through slots cut in the ocean paper, creating the classic "humps in the water" silhouette. The serpent is made from green card (#40A060) with simple paper eyes (white circles with black dot pupils) on its visible head. Its mouth is open in a friendly grin — a curved cut in the card with pink card (#FF80A0) visible inside as a tongue.

CLOUDS AND SKY: Behind the pop-up scene, a flat backdrop card rises from the back of the book's gutter — a semicircular piece of card printed with a gradient sky (pale blue #A0D0F0 to warm yellow #FFF0C0 near the bottom). Paper clouds are attached to the backdrop as small, separate layered pieces — white card clouds (#FFFFFF) with visible tabs connecting them to the backdrop, casting tiny shadows on the sky behind them.

A SUN in the upper corner of the backdrop — a circle of bright yellow card (#FFD040) with triangular paper rays attached around its circumference, each ray a separate cut piece of card folded slightly outward to catch the light.

POP-UP ENGINEERING DETAILS:

The cover must show the MECHANICS of pop-up construction:
- FOLD LINES: Visible creases where paper has been folded — crisp, geometric lines that are part of the structure's beauty
- PAPER TABS: Small rectangular paper extensions that connect moving parts — some visible where they attach pop-up elements to the base pages
- CUT EDGES: Clean, white edges where paper has been cut — the exposed inner fiber of cut card, creating thin white lines along every shaped edge
- SHADOW: Each pop-up element casts a real shadow on the elements behind and below it — the shadows are soft and indicate a light source from the upper-left
- PAPER TEXTURE: The visible surface texture of card stock — slightly smoother than regular paper, with the characteristic look of printed/painted card
- GLUE POINTS: Tiny, visible areas where paper pieces have been glued together — small, flat spots where adhesive has slightly changed the paper's surface quality

TEXT — PRINTED ON THE BOOK'S PAGES:

Title (positioned at 5-20% from top, appearing to be printed on the sky backdrop card):
"THE MAP TO" — in a bold, adventurous serif font (think Lora Bold or Merriweather Bold) in dark navy (#1A2040), appearing as though printed directly onto the sky backdrop card. Medium-large.
"EVERYWHERE" — on the next line, same font, LARGER, in bright treasure-gold (#D4AF37). The gold text echoes the treasure chest below.

Subtitle (positioned at 22% from top, on the backdrop): "A Pop-Up Adventure" — in small, clean sans-serif in ocean blue (#2080C0), letter-spacing 0.2em.

Author (positioned at 90-93% from top, on the open book page below the pop-up): "by LILA OKONKWO-YAMAMOTO" — in small serif in dark navy (#1A2040), appearing to be printed on the book's cream page.

OVERALL MOOD:

Wonder, discovery, tactile delight — the feeling of opening a pop-up book and gasping as a three-dimensional world rises from flat pages. Pop-up books represent the purest form of book magic — the physical transformation of paper into architecture, of pages into places. This cover captures that transformation mid-bloom.

THIS IS POP-UP PAPER ART. Folded, cut, engineered, three-dimensional. Visible fold lines, paper tabs, card edges, and real shadows. The beauty is in the engineering — how flat paper, through clever folding and cutting, becomes mountains, ships, and islands.
