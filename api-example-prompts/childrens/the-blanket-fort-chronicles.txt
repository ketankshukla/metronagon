ART STYLE: Mixed media — a photorealistic living room interior where a child's blanket fort has become a genuine fantasy castle through the power of imagination. The base environment is photographically real; the fantasy elements emerging from the fort are rendered in vivid watercolor illustration style, creating a visual split between reality and imagination occupying the same space.

---

A magical children's book cover that combines TWO art styles in one image — photorealistic photography for the "real world" and vivid watercolor illustration for the "imagination world" — seamlessly merged to show the moment when a blanket fort transforms into something extraordinary. The bottom half of the image is a cozy, photographically real living room; the top half erupts into a watercolor fantasy kingdom growing out of the blanket fort. The transition between reality and imagination is gradual and magical — the photographic textures of real blankets and pillows dissolve upward into painted turrets, illustrated dragons, and watercolor clouds.

THE REAL WORLD (bottom 55% of image):

A photorealistic living room at dusk — warm, domestic, recognizable:
- A BLANKET FORT occupies the center of the room: couch cushions, dining chairs tipped on their sides, and multiple blankets and sheets draped over the framework to create a tent-like structure. The fort is built with the characteristic engineering of a seven-year-old: ambitious, structurally questionable, and magnificent. A patchwork quilt in warm reds, blues, and yellows forms the main canopy. A striped bedsheet creates one wall. Pillows are stacked as battlements.
- Inside the fort's entrance (a triangular opening in the front), warm golden light glows — a flashlight inside, creating the amber warmth of a castle's hearth. Silhouetted against this light, the shape of a child sitting cross-legged inside, small and dark against the warm glow, holding what appears to be a book.
- The living room around the fort is normal and domestic: a beige carpet, a couch pushed aside to make room for the fort, a coffee table with a glass of milk and cookie crumbs, family photos on the wall. Through a window, the real sunset creates warm amber light.
- Everything in this lower zone is PHOTOREALISTIC — sharp, textured, lit with natural indoor light.

THE IMAGINATION WORLD (top 45% of image):

Growing UPWARD from the blanket fort, the fabric textures and photographic reality gradually dissolve into watercolor illustration. The blankets and sheets of the fort transform:
- The patchwork quilt's edges become watercolor-painted castle walls — the quilt's red squares becoming painted red stone blocks, the blue squares becoming painted blue flags and banners
- The striped bedsheet transforms into a painted tower — its stripes becoming the horizontal lines of stone courses in a watercolor castle turret
- The pillow battlements become genuine crenellated walls painted in loose, flowing watercolor
- By the time the image reaches the top 25%, the transformation is COMPLETE — there is no photography left, only vivid, loose watercolor illustration of a full fantasy castle against a painted sky

THE WATERCOLOR CASTLE:

A magnificent but whimsical castle rendered in loose, flowing watercolor — the kind of castle a child imagines, not architecturally accurate:
- Tall, improbable towers (too tall and thin to stand in reality) in warm watercolor stones — terracotta, warm grey, golden sandstone
- Colorful flags and pennants flying from every turret — each one a bright watercolor splash (red, blue, yellow, green, purple)
- A watercolor dragon (small, friendly, bright green with orange wings) perches on the tallest tower, rendered in loose, playful brushstrokes
- A painted moat with a tiny painted drawbridge
- Watercolor clouds in a painted sunset sky — loose, wet-on-wet washes of warm orange, pink, and purple

THE TRANSITION ZONE (approximately 35-55% from top):

The magical heart of the cover — the zone where photorealistic blankets become watercolor castle. This transition is NOT a hard line but a gradual dissolve:
- Real fabric textures (photographically rendered) at the bottom of the zone
- The textures become increasingly painterly moving upward — fabric weave becomes visible brushstrokes, photographic shadow becomes watercolor wash
- Small watercolor elements begin appearing in the still-photographic environment: painted butterflies, illustrated sparkles, small watercolor flowers growing from the blanket folds
- By the upper edge of the zone, the transformation is complete

THE LIGHTING SPLIT:

The real world below is lit with warm, indoor, natural evening light — soft, domestic, amber-toned. The imagination world above is lit by painted sunset light — brighter, more vivid, more dramatic, with the saturated warmth of watercolor pigment. The brightness increases upward, suggesting that imagination is literally more luminous than reality.

TEXT — SPLIT BETWEEN WORLDS:

Title (positioned at 5-22% from top, in the watercolor sky):
"THE BLANKET FORT" — in a warm, friendly serif font in deep watercolor red (#B03030) — the same red as the patchwork quilt in the real world below. The letters have a subtle watercolor texture — soft edges, slight color variation within each letter, as though they were painted. Medium-large, letter-spacing 0.1em.
"CHRONICLES" — on the next line, same font, same size, in warm castle-stone gold (#E0C890). The warm, illustrated quality of the text anchors it in the imagination world.

Subtitle (positioned at 24% from top): "Adventures in the Living Room" — in small, neat sans-serif in white (#FFFFFF), letter-spacing 0.2em. The clean, modern font contrasts with the painted title, bridging the real and imaginary worlds.

Author (positioned at 90-93% from top, in the real-world zone): "by THEO CHEN-OKAFOR" — in small, clean sans-serif in warm amber (#C0A060) — grounded in reality.

OVERALL MOOD:

Magical, relatable, empowering — the feeling that every child has had: building a blanket fort and KNOWING, in their heart, that it is a real castle. The split between photorealistic reality and watercolor imagination validates the child's experience — yes, it IS a castle, and here's what it looks like when imagination takes flight. The gradual transition (not a hard line) says: imagination doesn't replace reality, it GROWS from it.

THIS IS MIXED MEDIA — photorealistic photography merging into watercolor illustration. The beauty is in the transition — the magical zone where blankets become battlements, where pillows become parapets, and where a living room becomes a kingdom.
