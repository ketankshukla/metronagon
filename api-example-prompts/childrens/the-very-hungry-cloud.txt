THE VERY HUNGRY CLOUD — A WEATHER ADVENTURE
TYPE: Paperback Front Cover
DIMENSIONS: 1024 x 1536 pixels, sRGB color profile
GENRE: Children's Picture Book / Educational (ages 3-6)
ART STYLE: Torn paper collage in the tradition of classic picture book illustration — layered pieces of colored and textured paper torn (not cut) into shapes and arranged to create a scene. Visible paper edges, overlapping layers, and the tactile quality of handmade collage art. Inspired by the pioneering collage illustration tradition of children's publishing where caterpillars, bears, and other characters are built from layered tissue paper and painted textures.

---

A bright, tactile children's book cover created entirely from torn paper collage — every element in the image is a piece of colored paper that has been torn (NOT cut with scissors — torn, with the characteristic ragged, fibrous white edges that tearing creates) and layered on a background sheet. The style is the classic collage illustration technique used in landmark children's picture books: painted papers, tissue papers, and textured papers torn into shapes and arranged with an artist's eye. The result is an image with extraordinary tactile quality — the viewer can almost feel the paper layers and the rough torn edges.

THE CHARACTER — NIMBUS THE CLOUD (center, 25-65% from top):

Nimbus is a large, round, fluffy cloud character — the cover's star. Nimbus is built from MULTIPLE layers of torn white and pale grey paper:
- The base cloud shape is a large, irregular rounded form torn from thick white paper (#FFFFFF) — the edges are beautifully ragged, with white paper fibers visible along the tear line
- Layered on top: additional torn pieces of slightly different whites and very pale greys (#F0F0F0, #E8E8E8) creating the characteristic lumpy, three-dimensional quality of a cumulus cloud. Each layered piece adds depth and shadow where it overlaps the piece below
- Nimbus has a FACE: two large, round eyes made from torn circles of black paper (#1A1A1A) with smaller torn circles of white paper on top as highlights (the classic collage eye technique). The eyes are wide, eager, and hungry — positioned high on the cloud body, looking downward at the landscape below. A wide, open MOUTH is a torn crescent shape of dark grey paper (#4A4A4A), showing excitement and appetite. The mouth is open because Nimbus is about to EAT something (rain, sunshine, snow — whatever clouds eat in this story)
- Two small, stubby arms made from torn paper extend from the sides — simple rounded shapes with no fingers, reaching downward eagerly
- Nimbus's belly is slightly darker in the center (layers of pale grey paper) because it is FULL of weather — it has been eating all day

WHAT NIMBUS HAS EATEN — VISIBLE IN ITS BELLY:

Through the translucent layers of Nimbus's paper body, faint colored shapes are visible — the weather Nimbus has consumed:
- A torn yellow paper sun shape (partially visible through the white cloud layers)
- Tiny torn blue paper raindrops
- Small torn white paper snowflakes
These "eaten" weather elements are rendered as if they are BEHIND the cloud's body layers — visible through the translucent overlap of white tissue paper, creating a charming visual gag.

THE LANDSCAPE BELOW (65-95% from top):

Below Nimbus, a cheerful landscape created entirely from torn paper collage:

HILLS: Rolling hills in multiple shades of green — each hill a single large piece of torn green paper (bright emerald #30A060, soft sage #80A880, lime #A0D060) layered on top of each other front-to-back. The green papers have been pre-painted with subtle textures — brush strokes, sponge marks, and crayon scribbles that add visual richness to the flat color.

HOUSES: A small village of simple houses — each house built from torn paper pieces: a square of colored paper for the wall (red #E04040, yellow #FFD040, blue #4080C0), a triangle of darker paper for the roof, tiny rectangle windows of contrasting paper, and a door. The houses are deliberately simple and charming — a child could replicate them.

TREES: Simple tree shapes — each one a torn brown paper rectangle trunk with a torn green paper circle or oval on top for the canopy. Some trees have been made from pre-painted paper with visible brushstroke textures in the green.

FLOWERS: Tiny torn paper flowers scattered across the hills — each flower is 2-3 small torn pieces: a colored circle (pink, yellow, orange) on a short green stem.

THE SKY (0-25% from top, behind Nimbus):

The sky background is a single large piece of light blue paper (#A0D0F0) — not a painted sky but actual colored paper, with its own subtle fiber texture visible. Near the horizon (where the sky meets the hills), the blue paper lightens slightly. A few small torn paper birds (simple V-shapes torn from dark blue paper) fly in the sky around Nimbus.

COLLAGE TECHNIQUE — MUST LOOK HANDMADE:

- TORN EDGES: Every single paper piece has torn (not cut) edges — the characteristic ragged edge with visible white paper fibers along the tear line. This is the most important visual detail — it distinguishes collage from flat digital illustration
- LAYERING SHADOWS: Where paper pieces overlap, tiny shadows are visible along the upper edges of the overlapping piece — the natural shadow cast by one paper layer sitting on top of another. These shadows add depth and tactile quality
- PAPER TEXTURES: Different papers have different textures: smooth colored papers, rough textured papers, tissue papers (slightly translucent), papers that have been pre-painted with brushstrokes or sponge textures. This variety of surface quality is what makes collage illustration rich
- WHITE BACKING: The very edges of the image show a thin border of the white backing paper — the surface onto which all the collage pieces were glued
- GLUE MARKS: Very subtle, very faint — tiny areas where paper has been pressed flat by glue, creating slightly shinier patches. These are barely visible but add authenticity
- OVERLAPPING CONSTRUCTION: Every element is clearly CONSTRUCTED from multiple pieces — Nimbus from 8-10 white paper layers, each house from 4-5 pieces, each tree from 2-3 pieces. The construction is visible and charming

COLOR PALETTE — COLORED PAPER:

- Cloud whites: #FFFFFF, #F0F0F0, #E8E8E8
- Sky blue paper: #A0D0F0
- Hill greens: #30A060, #80A880, #A0D060
- House red: #E04040
- House yellow: #FFD040
- House blue: #4080C0
- Flower pink: #FF80A0
- Flower orange: #FF9040
- Brown (trunks, roofs): #6B4226
- Black (eyes, birds): #1A1A1A
All colors have the slightly matte, slightly fibrous quality of colored paper rather than painted color.

TEXT — BOLD AND PLAYFUL:

Title (positioned at 3-20% from top, centered over the sky):
"THE VERY" — in a bold, rounded sans-serif font in dark blue (#2040A0), rendered to look like it was printed on a separate strip of paper and glued to the cover — a thin torn-paper banner behind the text, slightly tilted
"HUNGRY" — on the next line, LARGER, in bright red (#E04040), same paper-banner treatment
"CLOUD" — on the next line, same size as "HUNGRY," in sky blue (#4080C0), same paper-banner treatment. Each title word on its own torn-paper strip creates a stacked, colorful, collage-integrated title treatment.

Subtitle (positioned at 22% from top, centered): "A Weather Adventure" — in smaller text on a single yellow paper strip, in dark blue text.

Author/Illustrator (positioned at 89-92% from top): "by AMARA WASHINGTON-TANAKA" — on a small green paper strip, in white text.

OVERALL MOOD:

Bright, tactile, irresistible — the feeling of making art with your hands, of tearing paper and discovering that the ragged edges are more beautiful than anything scissors could create. Nimbus is the perfect children's character: round, hungry, expressive, and slightly ridiculous. The collage technique makes the art feel ACCESSIBLE — a child looks at this and thinks "I could make that!" (and they should try).

THIS IS TORN PAPER COLLAGE. Handmade, tactile, layered. Visible torn edges, paper textures, glue shadows. The beauty is in the construction — how simple torn pieces of colored paper, layered with care and imagination, create a character and a world that feels alive.
