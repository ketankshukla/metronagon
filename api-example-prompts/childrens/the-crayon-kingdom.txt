THE CRAYON KINGDOM — WHERE COLORS COME ALIVE
TYPE: Paperback Front Cover
DIMENSIONS: 1024 x 1536 pixels, sRGB color profile
GENRE: Children's Picture Book (ages 4-7)
ART STYLE: Crayon drawing on paper — the entire cover rendered to look like it was drawn by a talented child using wax crayons on white drawing paper. Heavy, waxy crayon strokes, visible paper texture, the characteristic uneven coverage and bold colors of crayon art. Deliberately childlike but skillfully composed — the aesthetic of a drawing pinned to a refrigerator door that happens to be extraordinary.

---

A vibrant, joyful book cover that looks exactly like a large crayon drawing on white paper — not a digital simulation but a convincing reproduction of actual wax crayon art on thick white drawing paper. Every element shows the physical characteristics of crayon: the heavy, waxy strokes with their slightly uneven coverage, the way crayon skips over the paper's tooth leaving tiny white speckles in the color, the way colors layer and blend when pressed harder, and the characteristic bright, saturated hues of a new box of crayons. The drawing style is deliberately childlike in its approach — simple shapes, bold outlines, enthusiastic color — but executed with the compositional skill of a trained illustrator. It is what every child's drawing WANTS to be.

THE SCENE — A KINGDOM OF LIVING CRAYONS:

The drawing depicts a fantastical landscape where crayons are the inhabitants, the buildings, and the very terrain. A bright, cheerful kingdom built entirely from the logic of a child's imagination.

THE CASTLE (center, 25-60% from top): A large castle drawn in the classic child's castle style — a rectangular base with four turrets, each topped with a triangular roof and a small flag. But this castle is made of CRAYONS: the walls are drawn as rows of upright crayons standing side by side (each one a simple tapered rectangle with a pointed tip), in alternating colors — red, blue, yellow, green, red, blue — creating a rainbow-striped wall. The turret roofs are colored in solid bright red crayon with heavy, circular scribble-strokes showing the direction of the child-artist's hand. The flags are simple triangles in different colors (purple, orange, pink, green), each drawn with the bold simplicity of a child's flag: a stick (brown crayon line) and a triangle of color. Windows are simple black-crayon rectangles. A door is a brown arch shape with a yellow circle doorknob.

THE CRAYON CHARACTERS (scattered around the castle, 40-85% from top): Five or six LIVING CRAYONS — crayon-shaped characters (tall, tapered cylinders with pointed tips) with simple stick arms, stick legs, and drawn-on faces. Each crayon character is a different color and has a different personality expressed through simple facial features:
- RED CRAYON: The leader, standing tallest, with a confident smile (a simple curved line) and a tiny crown drawn on its wrapper
- BLUE CRAYON: Slightly shy, half-hidden behind the castle wall, with round worried eyes (two circles)
- YELLOW CRAYON: Jumping in the air with joy, stick arms raised, a huge grin (wide curved line with teeth shown as a zigzag)
- GREEN CRAYON: Sitting on the grass (which it is actively drawing — leaving a green crayon trail behind it as it moves), with a content, peaceful expression (closed-eye smile)
- PURPLE CRAYON: Wearing a simple drawn wizard hat, holding a star-tipped wand (drawing stars in the air that trail behind the wand)
- BROKEN ORANGE CRAYON: A crayon that has been broken in half but both halves are alive and holding hands, smiling — a character detail that speaks to resilience and friendship

THE LANDSCAPE:

THE SKY: The upper portion of the drawing is colored with bright blue crayon — the characteristic side-stroke technique of a child coloring sky, with visible horizontal crayon strokes that don't quite reach the edges, leaving small white paper gaps. A SUN in the upper corner is drawn in the classic child's style: a bright yellow circle with straight lines radiating outward as rays. The sun has a simple smiley face (two dots and a curved line).

CLOUDS: Simple rounded shapes left as white paper (uncolored) with light blue crayon outline — the child's technique of drawing cloud outlines and leaving the interior white.

GRASS: The ground is colored in vigorous green crayon strokes — some vertical (suggesting individual grass blades), some horizontal (suggesting a green field). The green is not uniform — it's clearly the work of an enthusiastic hand pressing hard in some areas (darker, more saturated green) and lighter in others. Yellow crayon flowers are scattered in the grass — simple shapes: a circle center with oval petals around it, each flower drawn with 3-4 quick strokes.

A RAINBOW arcs across the upper portion of the sky — drawn in the classic child's rainbow format: concentric arcs of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple crayon, each arc a single bold stroke. The rainbow is slightly wobbly — not geometrically perfect, because no child draws a perfect arc, and that imperfection is part of the charm.

CRAYON TECHNIQUE — MUST LOOK AUTHENTIC:

- PAPER TEXTURE: White drawing paper texture visible everywhere — the slight tooth/grain of the paper showing through as tiny white speckles in all colored areas, especially where crayon pressure was lighter
- WAXY BUILDUP: In areas of heavy coloring (the castle walls, the sun, the character bodies), the crayon wax builds up visibly — thicker, shinier, more saturated, with the slight glossy sheen of heavy crayon application
- STROKE DIRECTION: Every colored area shows visible stroke direction — the path of the crayon across the paper is traceable, adding energy and the unmistakable mark of a human hand
- COLOR MIXING: Where two crayon colors overlap (the rainbow arcs, the border between grass and sky), the colors blend in the characteristic waxy way — not smoothly mixed like paint but layered, with both colors remaining partially visible
- OUTLINE STYLE: Key shapes (characters, castle, sun) have bold black crayon outlines — thick, slightly wobbly lines drawn with confident pressure. The outlines are not perfectly smooth — they have the slight tremor of a hand moving quickly with a fat crayon
- CRAYON PAPER WRAPPER: Each crayon character has a visible paper wrapper around its middle — a simple band of white with tiny text suggesting the color name

TEXT — DRAWN IN CRAYON:

Title (positioned at 3-20% from top, centered):
"THE CRAYON" — rendered as though drawn in crayon by a slightly older child — the letters are hand-drawn, slightly uneven, each one a different color from the crayon palette (T in red, H in blue, E in yellow, C in green, R in orange, A in purple, Y in pink, O in red, N in blue). The letters are bold, slightly wobbly, and filled with visible crayon strokes. Each letter is approximately the same size but not perfectly aligned — they follow a slightly wavy baseline, as though written with enthusiasm but not a ruler.
"KINGDOM" — on the next line, same crayon-drawn letter style, same multi-color treatment, larger. The word "KINGDOM" is the biggest text on the cover, drawn with extra-heavy crayon pressure so the wax is thick and saturated.

Subtitle (positioned at 22% from top, centered): "Where Colors Come Alive" — in smaller crayon-drawn text, all in purple crayon, slightly neater than the title (as though a parent helped write this part).

Author/Illustrator (positioned at 88-92% from top, centered in the grass area): "by JASPER OAKLEY-DIALLO" — drawn in green crayon, simple and small.

OVERALL MOOD:

Pure, unfiltered childhood joy — the feeling of opening a brand new box of crayons and having an entire white page to fill. The crayon aesthetic is both nostalgic (adults remember the waxy smell and the bright colors) and immediate (children recognize this as THEIR art medium, THEIR visual language). The living crayon characters are delightful — they make the tool of creation into the characters of the story.

At thumbnail, the bold rainbow colors and the white paper background create instant child-appeal — it reads as "FUN" from across a room. At full resolution, the authentic crayon texture — the paper tooth, the waxy buildup, the stroke direction, the slightly wobbly outlines — is extraordinary in its convincing reproduction of real crayon art.

THIS IS CRAYON ART. Bold, waxy, bright, childlike. Visible paper texture, visible stroke direction, maximum color saturation. The beauty is in the authenticity — a drawing that looks like it could have been made by the most talented child in the world, with nothing but a box of crayons and a dream.
