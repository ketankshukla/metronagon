THE EXISTENTIAL DREAD OF BRUNCH — AND OTHER MODERN AFFLICTIONS
TYPE: Paperback Front Cover
DIMENSIONS: 1024 x 1536 pixels, sRGB color profile
GENRE: Humor / Social Commentary
ART STYLE: Flat-design editorial illustration — the clean, geometric, flat-color illustration style of modern editorial design (think New Yorker covers, Monocle illustrations, or premium app onboarding screens). Simple geometric figures, muted-but-sophisticated color palette, and the characteristic flat-design aesthetic where complex ideas are communicated through minimalist shapes and clever visual metaphors.

---

A clean, modern, editorially sophisticated book cover rendered in the flat-design illustration style of premium editorial publications — the graphic tradition where complex situations are distilled into simple geometric figures, flat color areas, and clever visual metaphors. The illustration depicts a minimalist brunch scene where everything is stylistically perfect but the central figure radiates existential crisis through pure body language and composition. The style is deliberately understated — the humor comes from the gap between the polished, Instagram-ready brunch aesthetic and the barely-contained psychological despair of the person experiencing it.

THE SCENE — THE BRUNCH TABLE:

A bird's-eye view (looking straight down) of a circular brunch table, rendered in flat geometric shapes:

THE TABLE: A perfect circle in warm, muted terracotta (#C0907) — approximately 60% of image width, centered at approximately 50% from top. The table is a flat circle with no shadow, no perspective — pure geometric shape.

THE BRUNCH ITEMS (arranged on the table in flat-design style):

Each brunch item is rendered as a simplified, geometric, flat-design icon:
- AVOCADO TOAST: A rectangular shape (toast) in warm brown (#B09060) with a green (#6A9A50) oval (avocado) and tiny geometric seeds. Positioned at 11 o'clock on the table.
- ACAI BOWL: A circular shape in deep purple (#5A2A5A) with small colorful geometric shapes on top (berries, granola). Positioned at 2 o'clock.
- MIMOSA: A simplified champagne flute — a triangle atop a thin rectangle — in pale gold (#E0D080). Positioned at 4 o'clock.
- LATTE ART: A circular mug shape viewed from above in white (#F0ECE8) with a simplified leaf pattern in the foam (the trendy latte art). Positioned at 7 o'clock.
- A SMALL SUCCULENT: A tiny geometric plant in a geometric pot — the mandatory Instagram prop. Positioned at 9 o'clock.
- A PHONE: A simplified rectangular smartphone shape, face-up, screen showing a miniature Instagram-like interface with a photo of THIS SAME TABLE (a meta-detail). Positioned near the mimosa.

All items are rendered in flat, solid colors with no shading, no texture, no outline — the pure flat-design aesthetic.

THE CENTRAL FIGURE (hands and head visible):

Visible at the edge of the table (6 o'clock position, approximately 70-80% from top), the central figure's upper body: simplified geometric hands flat on the table (one on either side of their plate) and a round head with minimal features resting face-down ON the table between the hands — the universal gesture of existential defeat. The figure has:
- A simple round head shape in a warm skin tone (#D8B898)
- Minimal geometric hair
- The body language of someone who has been asked "So what are you DOING with your life?" one too many times over eggs Benedict
- The figure is NOT looking at the brunch, NOT looking at the phone, NOT engaging with any of the carefully curated aesthetic — they have GIVEN UP, mid-brunch

THE SECOND FIGURE (across the table):

At the 12 o'clock position, a second figure — visible as hands holding up a phone, photographing the brunch spread. This figure is actively documenting the meal for social media while the central figure face-plants into the table. Only the hands and phone are visible — the rest of the figure is cropped by the image edge.

THE BACKGROUND:

A clean, flat color background — warm, muted sage green (#8AA888) — the characteristic muted, sophisticated neutral of contemporary editorial illustration. No texture, no gradient, no detail. The background extends to all edges.

FLAT-DESIGN TECHNIQUE:

- GEOMETRIC SIMPLIFICATION: Every object is reduced to its simplest geometric form — circles, rectangles, triangles. No organic shapes, no complex curves.
- FLAT COLOR: Zero gradients, zero textures, zero shading within any single shape. Each object is one or two solid colors.
- NO OUTLINES: Unlike pop art or cartoon styles, flat-design illustration uses NO outlines — shapes are defined by their color against the background, not by drawn borders.
- MUTED PALETTE: The colors are sophisticated and muted — not vivid primary colors but the warm, slightly desaturated tones of contemporary design. This palette signals "tasteful" and "editorial."
- MINIMAL DETAIL: Every detail is the MINIMUM needed for recognition — the mimosa is three shapes, the succulent is four shapes, the phone is a rectangle with three lines.

TEXT — MODERN EDITORIAL:

Title (positioned at 5-20% from top, centered above the table):
"THE EXISTENTIAL DREAD" — in a clean, modern sans-serif (think Circular, GT Walsheim, or similar contemporary design fonts) in warm off-white (#FFF0E0). Medium-large, letter-spacing 0.05em. The font is the kind used by lifestyle brands and editorial publications — effortlessly stylish.
"of BRUNCH" — on the next line, same font, LARGER, in warm terracotta (#C09070) — matching the table. "BRUNCH" is the biggest word and the visual anchor.

Subtitle (positioned at 22% from top): "And Other Modern Afflictions" — in small, light-weight sans-serif in warm off-white (#FFF0E0), letter-spacing 0.15em.

Author name (positioned at 90-93% from top): "MILLENNIAL VALE-OKAFOR" — in sans-serif in warm off-white (#FFF0E0), letter-spacing 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Stylish, wry, generationally specific — the feeling of sitting at a $28 brunch where everything is perfectly curated, the lighting is gorgeous, the avocado toast is photogenic, and you suddenly realize that all of this aesthetic perfection is making you feel MORE empty rather than less. The flat-design editorial style IS the aesthetic being satirized — the cover looks like the Instagram post it's mocking.

THIS IS FLAT-DESIGN EDITORIAL ILLUSTRATION. Geometric simplification, muted color palette, bird's-eye composition. The beauty is in the restraint — minimalist shapes that communicate maximum social commentary, and a face-down figure that says more than any detailed expression could.
