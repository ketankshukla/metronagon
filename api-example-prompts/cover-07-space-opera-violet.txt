---

A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic book cover rendered at 1024x1536 pixels in sharp cinematic digital style with advanced volumetric lighting, lens flares, and deep-space atmospheric effects. This must look like a $200-million Hollywood space opera poster — every surface, every star, every particle of light rendered with obsessive photographic precision. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly brushstrokes, NO soft-focus artistic filters. Every pixel must be razor-sharp, hyper-detailed, and cinematically lit.

SUBJECT — A FLEET COMMANDER ON THE BRIDGE OF A WARSHIP:

A man of South Asian descent in his early 40s, positioned in the lower-center of the image, standing at the helm of a massive warship bridge. He is captured from the waist up, body angled slightly right, his gaze fixed forward through a panoramic viewport that fills the background with the vastness of space. He wears a formal military command uniform — deep charcoal-black with sharp violet piping along the collar, shoulders, and cuffs. The uniform is tailored and precise — high Nehru-style collar, fitted across broad shoulders, with rank insignia on the collar: three interlocking silver stars above a violet nebula emblem. A long officer's coat drapes from his shoulders like a cape — the same charcoal-black with a violet silk lining visible at the edges. His hands are clasped behind his back in a classic command posture — one hand gripping the opposite wrist, the knuckles showing tension that his face does not betray. On his left wrist, a holographic command interface projects a faint tactical display — ship positions rendered in miniature violet and white light.

FACE — COMMANDING PHOTOREALISTIC DETAIL:

His face radiates quiet, unshakeable authority. Warm brown skin with golden undertones, cleanly shaven with the shadow of stubble along a strong, angular jaw. His bone structure is striking — prominent cheekbones, a straight nose with a slight ridge (broken once, healed well), deep-set eyes under strong brows. His eyes are dark brown, almost black, with extraordinary depth — the kind of eyes that have watched worlds burn and made the impossible decision anyway. The violet light from the tactical display and the distant nebula outside casts subtle violet highlights along his right cheekbone and temple, while the cooler white light of the bridge instruments illuminates his left side. His hair is jet black, cropped military-short on the sides with slightly more length on top, precisely maintained, a few silver strands at the temples — not age but stress, the cost of command. His expression is resolute and measured — not grim, not hopeful, but the focused calm of a man who has calculated every outcome and chosen the one that costs the least lives. A thin scar runs from his right ear to his jawline — a remnant of a battle that cost him his first ship.

BACKGROUND — DEEP SPACE FLEET FORMATION BEFORE A NEBULA:

Through the massive bridge viewport, an awe-inspiring vista of deep space unfolds. Dominating the upper portion of the image is a colossal nebula — the Starfall Nebula — a vast cloud of interstellar gas in breathtaking shades of deep violet, electric purple, magenta-pink, and pale lavender, shot through with veins of bright white where new stars are being born. The nebula is rendered with astronomical accuracy — filamentary structures, dark dust lanes, bright emission regions, and wispy tendrils extending outward like the fingers of a cosmic hand. Against the nebula, arranged in a dramatic V-formation, the Last Fleet is visible — dozens of warships of varying sizes, their hulls dark gunmetal grey with running lights in violet and white. The largest ship, a massive dreadnought, is positioned directly behind the commander's silhouette, its engine nacelles glowing with intense violet-white thrust plasma. Smaller escort vessels and fighter wings create a sense of vast military scale. Stars fill every gap between the ships and the nebula — thousands of pinpoint lights in white, blue-white, and pale yellow, creating a dense starfield of extraordinary depth.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

The bridge interior has subtle atmospheric haze from the holographic displays — faint violet light scattered through the air. Lens flares from the brightest stars and ship engines create cinematic streaks of violet-white light across the viewport. The nebula casts a diffuse purple-violet ambient glow across every surface — the commander's uniform, his skin, the bridge instruments. The overall palette is deep violet, charcoal black, silver-white, and electric purple — with warm amber accents from the bridge instrument panels. The mood is epic, solemn, and vast — the quiet before a battle that will decide the fate of civilizations.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

His face occupies roughly the 52%-68% vertical zone. The top 40% contains only the nebula, fleet, and starfield through the viewport. No part of his face or body enters the top 35%.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:

Line 1 (exactly 3% from top): "THE LAST FLEET SAGA" — small elegant sans-serif font, centered, silver-white color (#C0C0C0), letter-spacing 0.2em, approximately 14pt.

Line 2 (exactly 6% from top): "BOOK ONE" — sans-serif font, centered, violet color (#9B59B6), letter-spacing 0.2em, approximately 12pt. Flanked by thin horizontal silver lines.

Lines 3-4 (title block, exactly 10-22% from top): "STARFALL COVENANT" — large, bold sans-serif font, centered, bright white with a subtle violet glow emanating from behind the letters, as if lit by the nebula itself. "STARFALL" on one line, larger. "COVENANT" on the next. The letters have a metallic quality — faint chrome reflections.

Line 5 (exactly 26% from top): "The Last Fleet Rises" — smaller italic sans-serif, centered, pale violet/silver color with a soft glow.

Line 6 (exactly 92% from top): "ARJUN RAMASWAMY" — large sans-serif font, centered, silver-white, letter-spacing 0.2em. Clean and commanding.

OVERALL MOOD:

Epic, vast, solemn — the feeling of standing on the bridge of a warship as the last hope of humanity forms up behind you, and the impossible battle ahead is the only option left. The violet-dominated palette creates a distinctive visual identity that separates this from the typical blue-and-orange sci-fi covers. At thumbnail, the bright nebula and fleet silhouettes create instant sci-fi recognition and visual impact.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting texture. NO watercolor. NO canvas grain. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — sharp, vast, and awe-inspiring.
