THE COLOR OF FORGETTING — A NOVEL
TYPE: Paperback Front Cover
DIMENSIONS: 1024 x 1536 pixels, sRGB color profile
GENRE: Literary Fiction / Memory & Loss
ART STYLE: Abstract expressionist color field painting — a large, soft-edged rectangular field of muted color floating on a darker ground, in the tradition of contemplative abstract painting where color itself becomes the emotional subject. No figures, no objects, no text effects — only luminous, breathing color that evokes memory fading. Inspired by the color field painters who proved that two rectangles of color, properly chosen, can make you weep.

---

A profoundly contemplative book cover rendered as an abstract expressionist color field painting — the artistic tradition where large, soft-edged areas of luminous color float on a canvas, and the emotional impact comes entirely from the relationships between colors, their edges, and the light they seem to emit. There are NO figures, NO objects, NO symbols — only color, carefully chosen and precisely applied, creating an image that is about the experience of looking at color itself. The painting evokes the feeling of memory dissolving — something warm and vivid fading at its edges into something cool and indistinct.

THE PAINTING:

The cover is a single abstract painting — a vertical canvas with two primary color elements:

THE FIELD (center, approximately 20-75% from top):

A large, soft-edged rectangular area of warm color — not a hard-edged geometric shape but a luminous, breathing zone of color that hovers on the darker ground with soft, blurred boundaries:

The color of the field is a complex, layered warm tone — not a single flat color but a LIVING color built from multiple translucent layers of oil paint:
- The dominant tone is a warm, muted apricot-amber (#D0A078) — the color of late afternoon sunlight on a bedroom wall, of golden hour, of a memory that was once vivid
- Within the field, subtle variations: warmer areas (#E0B888) where the paint is thicker and more opaque, cooler areas (#B89068) where the underlying layers show through
- The very center of the field is the warmest and most luminous — the heart of the memory, still vivid
- Moving toward the edges, the warm color begins to COOL and FADE — the apricot shifts toward a cooler, more muted grey-lavender (#A09098) as though the warmth is being leached away. This cooling at the edges is the painting's central metaphor: memory warm at its center, fading to grey at its boundaries

THE EDGES: The field's edges are not defined by a line but by a gradual dissolution — the warm apricot zone fades into the surrounding darker color over a distance of approximately 3-5% of image width. This soft, breathing edge is the most important visual element — it represents the boundary between remembering and forgetting, and that boundary is not sharp but gradual, uncertain, and constantly shifting.

THE GROUND (surrounding the field):

Behind and around the central field, a darker, cooler color — the ground tone against which the warm field floats:
- Deep, muted blue-grey (#3A3A48) — the color of twilight, of distance, of things just beyond the reach of memory
- The ground is not flat — it has subtle tonal variation, slightly warmer near the field's edges (influenced by the warm light of the field) and slightly cooler at the canvas edges
- The ground occupies the top 20%, bottom 25%, and narrow side margins — surrounding the warm field on all sides, containing it, slowly encroaching

THE RELATIONSHIP: The warm field floats ON the cool ground — there is a subtle sense of depth, as though the warm color is closer to the viewer than the cool ground behind it. This spatial illusion is created purely through color temperature: warm colors advance, cool colors recede. The effect is of looking through a window at something warm that is slowly moving away.

PAINTING TECHNIQUE:

- OIL ON CANVAS: The characteristic surface of oil paint on stretched linen — the canvas weave is visible throughout, especially in thinner areas. The texture adds material presence to the abstract color.
- LAYERED APPLICATION: The paint has been applied in multiple thin layers (glazes) and thicker areas (scumbles), creating a surface that has visible physical depth — thinner areas show the canvas weave and lower paint layers; thicker areas have a subtle raised quality.
- SOFT EDGES: Achieved by carefully blending wet-into-wet at the field boundaries — the warm and cool colors are not mixed but allowed to overlap and intermingle, creating a zone of complex intermediate tones at the edges.
- NO HARD LINES: There is not a single hard edge or defined shape anywhere in the painting. Everything is soft, graduated, breathing.
- BRUSHWORK: Visible but not dramatic — soft, horizontal strokes in the field (suggesting calm), broader, more gestural strokes in the ground (suggesting depth). The brushwork follows the tradition of color field painting where the mark-making is subordinate to the color.

COLOR PALETTE — MEMORY AND FORGETTING:

- Warm field center: #D0A078 (apricot-amber)
- Warm field bright: #E0B888 (thickest paint areas)
- Field edge cooling: #B89068 → #A09098 (the fade to grey)
- Ground deep: #3A3A48 (blue-grey twilight)
- Ground near field: #4A4A50 (slightly warmer where influenced by the field)
- Canvas showing through: #D8D0C0 (the warm tone of raw linen, visible in thin areas)

TEXT — BARELY THERE:

Title (positioned at 8-20% from top, centered in the cool ground area above the warm field):
"THE COLOR of" — in an extremely thin, elegant serif (think Cormorant Garamond Thin or Bodoni Thin) in a quiet grey (#6A6A70) — slightly lighter than the ground, visible but not assertive. The text is deliberately understated — it does not compete with the painting. Medium size, letter-spacing 0.15em.
"FORGETTING" — on the next line, same thin serif, same quiet grey, slightly larger. The word "FORGETTING" is the longest and carries the most space — its length across the page mirrors the slow, extended process it names.

Subtitle (positioned at 22% from top): "a novel" — in the thinnest possible serif, in a grey barely distinguishable from the ground (#505058), all lowercase, letter-spacing 0.4em. Almost invisible. Almost forgotten.

Author name (positioned at 82-85% from top, in the cool ground below the warm field): "MIRIAM ASHWORTH-OKAFOR" — in thin serif in quiet grey (#6A6A70), letter-spacing 0.25em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Contemplative, melancholic, luminously beautiful — the feeling of looking at a photograph from decades ago and realizing that the colors have faded at the edges, that the faces are less sharp than they once were, that the warmth of the memory is slowly being absorbed by the surrounding grey of forgetting. The color field painting tradition creates emotional impact purely through the interaction of carefully chosen colors — no narrative content is needed, because the colors ARE the narrative.

THIS IS COLOR FIELD ABSTRACT PAINTING. Soft-edged luminous color on a darker ground. No figures, no objects, no symbols — only the profound emotional language of warm color fading to cool, of memory dissolving at its edges, of something beautiful that is almost, but not quite, still there.
