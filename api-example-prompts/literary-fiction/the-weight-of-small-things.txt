---

A quiet, powerful book cover rendered as an intimate still-life oil painting in the tradition of Dutch Golden Age masters — the painting tradition that found profound beauty and meaning in ordinary domestic objects. The scene depicts a simple kitchen table with the remnants of a solitary meal and a few personal objects, each one painted with luminous precision and each one carrying the weight of an untold story. The painting is side-lit, warm, and intensely focused — every scratch on the table surface, every crumb on the plate, every fold in the letter is rendered with the loving attention that transforms the mundane into the monumental.

THE TABLE (filling 40-95% of the image):

A worn wooden kitchen table — not a beautiful antique but an everyday table that has been used for decades. The surface is rendered with extraordinary material detail: the warm, honey-toned wood (#B09060) showing years of use — ring stains from coffee mugs, knife scratches, a slightly warped surface, the worn-smooth edges where hands have rested. The table is not centered — it is cropped, showing only a portion, as though the viewer has just sat down at someone else's table.

THE OBJECTS — EACH ONE A STORY:

A HALF-EATEN MEAL: A simple white ceramic plate (#F0ECE8) with a half-eaten piece of toast and a smear of jam. A butter knife rests across the plate's rim, angled as though set down mid-bite. A half-full cup of tea (#C08840, the warm amber of milky tea) in a plain white mug, a tea bag string hanging over the side. The meal is unfinished — someone was interrupted, or someone lost their appetite.

A FOLDED LETTER: Beside the plate, a letter — a single sheet of paper, folded in thirds as though it arrived in an envelope, then opened, read, and set down. The paper is white (#F8F4F0) with faint blue lines — handwritten, not typed. The handwriting is visible but not readable at cover scale — slanting, hurried strokes in blue ballpoint ink (#2A3A6A). A corner of the paper has been torn — someone gripped it too tightly. The envelope lies beneath, addressed in the same handwriting, the stamp cancelled.

A SET OF KEYS: Two keys on a plain metal ring — a house key and a smaller key (a mailbox key or a diary key), lying on the table near the plate. The keys are ordinary, worn brass (#B0A060) with the dull sheen of keys that have been carried in a pocket for years. They have been SET DOWN with finality — not tossed casually but placed deliberately, as though being returned or surrendered.

A WILTING FLOWER: In a simple clear glass (#E0E0E0 with transparency) of water, a single cut flower — a white rose (#F0E8E0) that is past its prime: petals slightly brown at the edges, one petal fallen and lying on the table surface, the stem bent. The water in the glass is slightly cloudy. The flower was not replaced when it should have been — a small neglect that speaks to larger neglect.

A PAIR OF READING GLASSES: Folded, lying beside the letter — simple wire-frame reading glasses (#C0C0C0) with fingerprint smudges on the lenses visible in the side-light. The glasses belong to the person who read the letter.

LIGHTING — INTIMATE AND REVELATORY:

A single light source from the left — warm, soft, directional. The light is the characteristic side-lighting of Dutch still-life: it enters from a window (not visible, just implied) and rakes across the table surface at a low angle, creating:
- Bright highlights on the left sides of objects (the mug rim, the glass of water, the key surfaces)
- Deep, warm shadows on the right sides
- Long, soft shadows cast across the table by each object
- The characteristic play of light through transparent and translucent objects: the glass of water refracts the light, the tea in the mug glows with transmitted warm amber, the flower petals are slightly translucent where thin

The background behind the table is dark — a dark, warm interior (#1A1408) with just enough detail to suggest a kitchen: the edge of a chair, the corner of a window frame, the faint shape of a wall clock. The darkness focuses all attention on the lit table surface and its objects.

PAINTING TECHNIQUE:

- GLAZED OIL: Multiple translucent layers creating luminous depth — light penetrates the upper paint layers, reflects off the lighter underpainting, and returns through the glazes with the characteristic warm glow of Dutch still-life
- MATERIAL PRECISION: Each surface is rendered with its specific material quality: the matte roughness of toast, the smooth glaze of ceramic, the cold polish of keys, the translucency of water, the soft tissue of flower petals
- VISIBLE BRUSHWORK: Minimal in the detailed foreground objects (smooth, blended, precise), more visible in the dark background (broader, atmospheric strokes)
- CANVAS TEXTURE: Faintly visible beneath the paint

TEXT — QUIET AND LITERARY:

Title (positioned at 5-18% from top, centered over the dark upper background):
"THE WEIGHT of" — in an elegant, light serif (think Cormorant Garamond or EB Garamond Light) in warm cream (#E8D8C0). Medium size, letter-spacing 0.1em. The light weight of the font contrasts with the heavy word it spells.
"SMALL THINGS" — on the next line, same font, slightly LARGER, in warm brass gold (#B0A060) — matching the keys on the table. The heavier visual weight of the larger text mirrors the title's meaning: small things carry unexpected weight.

Subtitle (positioned at 20% from top): "a novel" — in the smallest possible text, thin serif, in warm brown (#6A5A40), all lowercase, letter-spacing 0.3em. Understated. Literary.

Author name (positioned at 91-94% from top): "ANNA BLACKWELL-OKAFOR" — in light serif in warm cream (#E8D8C0), letter-spacing 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Quiet, heavy, deeply human — the feeling of sitting at a kitchen table after receiving news that changes everything, looking at the ordinary objects around you and seeing them, for the first time, as evidence of a life that is about to change. The still-life tradition finds meaning in objects — and these objects (the unfinished meal, the read letter, the surrendered keys, the wilting flower) tell a story that is simultaneously specific and universal.

THIS IS DUTCH STILL-LIFE OIL PAINTING. Luminous glazing, intimate side-light, material precision. The beauty is in the ordinary — a kitchen table painted with the same reverence and skill as any royal portrait, because the story it tells is just as important.
