THE ATLAS OF INVISIBLE CITIES — A NOVEL
TYPE: Paperback Front Cover
DIMENSIONS: 1024 x 1536 pixels, sRGB color profile
GENRE: Literary Fiction / Magical Realism
ART STYLE: Architectural blueprint meets dreamscape — a precise, white-on-blue architectural floor plan of a city that could not exist, drawn with the technical precision of a real blueprint but depicting impossible architecture: stairs that lead to clouds, rooms that open into oceans, bridges connecting buildings that exist in different centuries. Cyanotype blue with white line-work.

---

A visually inventive book cover rendered as an architectural blueprint — the precise, technical, white-on-blue drawing format used by architects and engineers — but depicting a city that defies physics, geometry, and time. The blueprint shows a bird's-eye floor plan of an impossible urban layout: buildings that overlap in time, streets that curve into themselves, rooms with doorways that open onto other continents, and structures that exist in multiple scales simultaneously. The technical precision of the drawing style (every line ruler-straight, every angle measured) makes the impossibility feel PLANNED — as though someone drafted the blueprints for a dream.

THE BLUEPRINT SURFACE:

The entire background is the characteristic deep cyanotype blue (#0A2050) of architectural blueprints — the distinctive indigo-blue that results from the iron-salt photographic process historically used to reproduce architectural drawings. The blue is not flat — it has the slight variation and texture of real cyanotype paper: slightly darker at the edges (where chemical concentration was higher during exposure), slightly lighter in the center, with a faint, fibrous paper texture visible through the blue.

THE WHITE LINEWORK (filling 10-90% of the image):

All drawing is in white (#FFFFFF) and pale blue-white (#D0E0FF) on the blue ground — the characteristic reversed-out appearance of blueprint reproduction:

THE CITY PLAN: A complex, detailed architectural floor plan viewed from directly above — the bird's-eye plan of an entire city district, drawn with architectural precision:

BUILDINGS: Rectangular floor plans of various sizes — each one drawn with the precise conventions of architectural drafting: wall thickness indicated by double lines, doorways shown as arcs (the swing path of the door), windows shown as thin parallel lines in the wall, and room layouts visible within. Each building is labeled in tiny, precise lettering: "THE LIBRARY OF TIDES" / "THE STATION OF PERPETUAL ARRIVAL" / "THE GARDEN THAT REMEMBERS" — names that suggest the impossible nature of these structures.

THE IMPOSSIBLE ELEMENTS:
- A staircase drawn in precise plan-view that spirals upward through the page and, at its top, continues AS A CLOUD — the architectural line-work transforms into the meteorological symbol for cumulus clouds, maintaining the same line weight and precision
- A building whose floor plan is drawn at TWO DIFFERENT SCALES simultaneously — the left half at 1:100 scale (showing room detail), the right half at 1:10000 scale (showing it as a city block) — the two scales sharing a common wall, impossible but precisely drafted
- A street that curves into a perfect circle and connects back to itself — a Möbius-strip road drawn in plan view, with tiny arrow symbols indicating traffic flow in impossible directions
- A room with four doorways, each one labeled with a compass bearing: "N — TOKYO," "S — BUENOS AIRES," "E — ISTANBUL," "W — REYKJAVIK" — doorways that open onto different cities
- A bridge connecting two buildings that are labeled with different dates: "COMPLETED 1847" and "COMPLETED 2093" — a bridge between centuries
- A garden drawn with botanical symbols (the standard architectural symbols for trees, shrubs, and grass) that spell a word when viewed from above — the word "REMEMBER"

TECHNICAL DRAWING ELEMENTS:
- DIMENSION LINES: Standard architectural dimensioning — lines with arrows at each end and measurements in meters: "47.3m," "∞ m," "πm" — some measurements possible, some infinite, some irrational
- SCALE BAR: "SCALE: 1:MEMORY" — printed in the standard scale bar format
- TITLE BLOCK: In the lower-right corner, a standard architectural title block with border lines containing: "THE ATLAS OF INVISIBLE CITIES / SHEET 7 OF ∞ / DRAWN BY: THE DREAMER / CHECKED BY: NOBODY / DATE: ALL DATES"
- GRID REFERENCES: Around the edges, a coordinate grid with letters and numbers — but the numbers are not sequential (they run 1, 3, 7, 42, ∞) and the letters include characters from multiple alphabets
- NORTH ARROW: A standard architectural north arrow — but with FOUR north directions pointing in different directions, labeled "TRUE NORTH," "MEMORY NORTH," "DREAM NORTH," and "NORTH OF FORGETTING"
- SECTION MARKS: Standard section cut indicators (circles with arrows showing viewing direction) placed at key points, labeled "SEE SHEET: CHILDHOOD" or "SEE SHEET: THE FUTURE"

REVISION CLOUDS: Several areas of the blueprint have standard architectural REVISION CLOUDS (the bumpy, cloud-like outlines used to mark changes on blueprints) circling modified areas. The revisions are labeled: "REV. A — REALITY ADJUSTED" / "REV. B — MEMORY CORRECTED" / "REV. C — DREAM INCORPORATED"

LINE QUALITY:

All lines are the precise, consistent-weight lines of architectural drafting:
- Thick lines (#FFFFFF at full opacity) for walls and major structures
- Medium lines (#D0E0FF) for interior partitions and secondary elements
- Thin lines (#A0C0E0) for dimensions, annotations, and grid lines
- Dashed lines for hidden or below-grade elements (standard architectural convention)
- Dot-dash lines for center lines and axes of symmetry

COLOR PALETTE — BLUEPRINT:

- Cyanotype blue: #0A2050 — background
- White line: #FFFFFF — primary linework, walls
- Pale blue-white: #D0E0FF — secondary linework
- Light blue: #A0C0E0 — annotations, dimensions, grid
- Paper texture: slight warm variation in the blue ground

TEXT — ARCHITECTURAL LETTERING:

Title (positioned at 3-14% from top, centered, in the blueprint's header area):
"THE ATLAS of" — in precise, architectural lettering (think the clean, mono-weight, slightly condensed hand-lettering of architectural drawings, or a font like Architect's Daughter or similar) in white (#FFFFFF). The letterforms are geometric and precise — the kind of letters an architect draws with a template.
"INVISIBLE CITIES" — on the next line, same architectural lettering, LARGER. The title is formatted as a standard blueprint drawing title.

Subtitle (positioned at 16% from top): "A NOVEL" — in small architectural lettering in pale blue (#D0E0FF), letter-spacing 0.3em.

Author name (positioned in the title block at lower-right, or at 90-93% from top centered): "ITALO BLACKWELL-OKAFOR" — in architectural lettering in white.

OVERALL MOOD:

Dreamy, precise, impossible — the feeling of finding architectural blueprints for a building that could not exist, drawn by someone who believed it could. The blueprint format treats the impossible with the same technical rigor as the possible — and in doing so, makes the impossible feel buildable. The literary fiction reader recognizes the metaphor instantly: we all carry blueprints for cities that don't exist — cities made of memory, imagination, and longing.

THIS IS ARCHITECTURAL BLUEPRINT OF THE IMPOSSIBLE. White-on-blue cyanotype, precise technical drafting, standard architectural conventions applied to structures that defy reality. The beauty is in the precision applied to the impossible — dreams drawn with a ruler.
