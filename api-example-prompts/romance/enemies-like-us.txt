ENEMIES LIKE US — THE THORNTON BROTHERS BOOK ONE
TYPE: Paperback Front Cover

GENRE: Enemies-to-Lovers Romance / Spicy Contemporary
ART STYLE: Bold split-diagonal design — the cover divided diagonally into two contrasting halves, each representing one character.

---

A bold, graphic, typography-forward book cover built on a DIAGONAL SPLIT design — the cover divided by a sharp diagonal line running from the upper-left to the lower-right, creating two triangular halves that represent the two opposing characters. Each half has its own distinct color world, texture, and energy. Where the two halves meet along the diagonal, the colors clash, blend, and spark — a visual metaphor for the enemies-to-lovers dynamic. There are NO illustrated people on this cover — the romance is communicated entirely through abstract color, texture, and the electric tension of the diagonal divide.

THE DIAGONAL SPLIT:

A razor-sharp diagonal line runs from approximately the upper-left corner (10% from left, 0% from top) to the lower-right corner (90% from left, 100% from top), dividing the cover into two triangular zones. The line itself is not invisible — it is rendered as a thin strip (approximately 1% of image width) of brilliant white (#FFFFFF) that crackles with energy: tiny spark-like highlights and hair-thin branching lines extending from the main diagonal, like electricity arcing across a gap. This white-hot diagonal is the cover's central visual element — the line where two opposing forces meet.

THE WARM HALF (upper-right triangle):

The upper-right triangle is the domain of FIRE and WARMTH:
- Base color: Deep, rich amber (#C87020) transitioning to vivid burnt orange (#E06010) toward the diagonal edge
- Texture: The surface has a subtle texture of brushed metal — like copper or bronze that has been heated until it glows. Fine, directional brush marks run parallel to the diagonal, creating a sense of movement and energy flowing TOWARD the divide
- Light effects: Near the diagonal, the warm half intensifies — the amber brightens to near-white gold (#FFE080), as though the proximity to the opposing force is heating this side to incandescence. Small particle effects — tiny dots and streaks of bright gold — scatter near the diagonal like sparks
- The warm half represents: passion, anger, heat, the character who burns

THE COOL HALF (lower-left triangle):

The lower-left triangle is the domain of ICE and CONTROL:
- Base color: Deep navy blue (#0A1A3A) transitioning to cold steel blue (#3A5A7A) toward the diagonal edge
- Texture: The surface has a subtle texture of frost on glass — fine crystalline patterns (similar to window frost) in slightly lighter blue-white, creating an intricate, geometric natural pattern. The frost lines run perpendicular to the diagonal, creating visual opposition to the warm half's directional flow
- Light effects: Near the diagonal, the cool half intensifies — the navy brightens to electric ice-blue (#60A0E0), as though the cold is concentrating at the point of contact. Small crystalline effects — tiny ice-shard shapes — scatter near the diagonal like frost crystals
- The cool half represents: control, calculation, cold precision, the character who freezes

THE COLLISION ZONE (along the diagonal):

Where the two halves meet, a narrow zone of visual chaos exists — approximately 3-5% of the image width on either side of the white diagonal line. In this zone:
- Warm amber particles and cool blue crystals intermingle
- The two color temperatures create unexpected tertiary colors where they overlap: warm violet (#8040A0), electric teal (#40A0A0), and pale lavender (#C0A0D0)
- The white diagonal line flares and pulses — brighter at the center of the cover (where the tension is highest) and slightly dimmer at the corners
- The overall effect suggests two forces that are trying to destroy each other but are instead creating something new and beautiful at their point of contact

TEXT — BOLD, MODERN, SPLIT ACROSS THE DIVIDE:

Title (positioned at 8-28% from top, centered, CROSSING the diagonal):
"ENEMIES" — in a massive, ultra-bold condensed sans-serif font (think Bebas Neue or Impact) in bright white (#FFFFFF). The word is positioned so that its left portion falls on the cool blue half and its right portion falls on the warm amber half — the word CROSSES the diagonal divide, existing in both worlds simultaneously. The letters are large enough to be the dominant visual element.
"LIKE US" — on the next line, same font, slightly smaller, also crossing the diagonal. Same white color. The white text unifies the split composition — it belongs to neither side and both sides.

Series line (positioned at 30% from top, centered): "The Thornton Brothers — Book One" — in small, thin sans-serif in white (#FFFFFF), letter-spacing 0.25em. Positioned to cross the diagonal.

Tagline (positioned at 85% from top, centered): "She's fire. He's ice. Together they're a disaster." — in small italic sans-serif in pale lavender (#C0A0D0) — the collision-zone color, suggesting the merger of the two forces. All lowercase, letter-spacing 0.1em.

Author name (positioned at 90-93% from top, centered): "SABRINA DRAKE-OKONKWO" — in bold sans-serif capitals in white (#FFFFFF), letter-spacing 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Electric, oppositional, magnetic — the feeling of two people who cannot stand each other and cannot stay apart. The diagonal split is a visual argument: these two forces are incompatible, but the collision zone where they meet is the most visually interesting part of the image. The abstract, graphic approach is deliberately different from traditional romance covers — it signals "modern, bold, and unafraid" to readers who want their romance with edge.

At thumbnail, the warm-amber/cool-navy diagonal split with the bold white title crossing the divide is immediately eye-catching and graphically strong. At full resolution, the metal and frost textures, the spark and crystal effects along the diagonal, and the collision-zone color mixing are extraordinary.

THIS IS GRAPHIC DESIGN AS ROMANCE. Abstract, bold, geometric. No people, no illustration — just color, texture, and the irresistible visual tension of two opposing forces meeting along a sharp diagonal line. The beauty is in the opposition and the inevitable fusion.
