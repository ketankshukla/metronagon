---

An elegant, restrained book cover built on the visual language of Regency-era silhouette art and cameo jewelry. The design is MINIMALIST compared to the elaborate illustration of other covers — its power comes from elegance, negative space, and the timeless beauty of two profiles facing each other in the candlelit intimacy of a cameo portrait. The overall aesthetic is Georgian decorative arts: classical proportions, symmetrical composition, gold-on-jewel-tone color schemes, and ornamentation that is elaborate but never excessive.

THE CENTRAL CAMEO (centered, 25-75% from top):

A large oval cameo occupies the center of the cover — approximately 60% of the image width and 50% of the image height. The cameo is rendered as a three-dimensional object: a slightly convex oval with a raised carved surface and a surrounding frame, as though it were an actual piece of Regency-era jewelry photographed at high resolution.

THE CAMEO SURFACE: The interior of the cameo is a smooth, warm surface in pale shell-pink (#F0D8C8) — the color of genuine shell cameo, with the subtle translucency and warmth of carved conch shell. Against this pale ground, TWO SILHOUETTE PROFILES face each other:

LEFT PROFILE — THE DUKE: A man's profile facing right, rendered as a solid, flat silhouette in deep charcoal (#1A1A1A). The silhouette captures aristocratic Regency-era features with period-accurate detail: a strong jawline, a straight nose with a slight aquiline curve, a high forehead, and hair styled in the characteristic Regency fashion — short at the back, with longer waves swept forward over the temples in the Byronic style. His collar is high and stiff — the characteristic Regency cravat and high shirt collar, tied in an elaborate knot. The silhouette's edges are crisp and precise, like a profile cut by a skilled silhouette artist at a Regency-era fair.

RIGHT PROFILE — THE LADY: A woman's profile facing left, also rendered as a solid silhouette in the same deep charcoal. Her profile captures Regency beauty: a delicate chin, a small straight nose, long lashes visible as a fine serrated edge at the eye, and a graceful neck. Her hair is styled in the Regency fashion: pulled up in an elaborate arrangement of curls and braids piled atop her head, with a few loose ringlets escaping to frame her face and trail along her neck. A small jeweled hair ornament (rendered as a tiny bright accent — a single point of gold) glints in her upswept hair.

THE SPACE BETWEEN: The two profiles are close — almost touching — separated by approximately 5% of the cameo width. In this narrow space between their faces, a single decorative element: a tiny silhouette of a playing card (the ace of hearts) falling between them, rendered at the same scale as the profile details. This card references the "wager" of the title — a gambling metaphor for love.

THE CAMEO FRAME: The oval cameo is surrounded by an ornate frame rendered in gold (#D4AF37) with the three-dimensional quality of actual jewelry: a twisted rope border (the classic cameo setting), with small decorative acanthus leaf details at the four cardinal points (top, bottom, left, right). The gold frame catches the light with subtle highlights and shadows that give it a convincing metallic dimensionality. A small bow-shaped clasp at the top of the oval — the kind of clasp that would attach the cameo to a ribbon or chain — adds authenticity to the jewelry illusion.

THE BACKGROUND:

Behind the cameo, the background is a rich, deep, jewel-toned field — NOT a solid flat color but a luxurious fabric texture: deep emerald green silk (#0A3A2A) with a subtle moiré pattern (the characteristic wavy interference pattern of tightly woven silk, rendered as very faint, flowing diagonal lines). The silk texture gives the background tactile richness while remaining understated — it is the velvet lining of a jewelry box, the backdrop against which the cameo shines.

In the four corners of the image, small decorative elements in gold line-work: classical Regency-era ornaments — symmetrical arrangements of acanthus scrolls, laurel branches, and small rosettes. These corner decorations are thin, precise, and elegant — gold (#D4AF37) linework on the dark green background, adding period-appropriate ornamentation without cluttering the composition.

COLOR PALETTE — REGENCY RESTRAINT:

- Deep emerald silk: #0A3A2A — background
- Shell pink: #F0D8C8 — cameo surface
- Charcoal silhouette: #1A1A1A — profiles
- Gold: #D4AF37 — frame, ornaments, text, accents
- Cream white: #FFF5E0 — brightest highlights on gold frame
- Deep shadow: #050A08 — darkest accents in background texture
Only FIVE colors in the entire cover. The restraint is the point — this is Regency elegance, not Victorian excess.

TEXT — CLASSICAL SERIF WITH GOLD FOIL:

Title (positioned at 5-20% from top, centered above the cameo):
"THE DUKE'S" — in an elegant, classical serif font (think Baskerville, Caslon, or Garamond — the typefaces of the Georgian era) in gold (#D4AF37). Medium-large, letter-spacing 0.15em. The gold text should appear to have the slight dimensional quality of gold foil stamping — a printing technique where metallic foil is pressed into the cover surface, creating letters that catch the light.
"WAGER" — on the next line, same font, LARGER, in the same gold. The word "WAGER" carries the visual and thematic weight.

Between the title and the cameo, a thin decorative line: a horizontal arrangement of three small diamond shapes connected by hairline rules, in gold — a classical typographic ornament.

Series line (positioned at 78-80% from top, centered below the cameo): "A Thornfield Hall Novel" — in small italic serif in gold (#D4AF37), letter-spacing 0.1em.

Author name (positioned at 90-93% from top, centered): "CHARLOTTE ASHWORTH-MENSAH" — in serif capitals in gold (#D4AF37), letter-spacing 0.25em. Below the name, a tiny decorative ornament: two crossed quill pens in gold linework.

OVERALL MOOD:

Elegant, intimate, restrained — the feeling of finding a perfect cameo brooch in an antique shop and knowing, from the two profiles facing each other, that it was a love token. The minimalism is deliberate and powerful — in a genre full of shirtless dukes and windswept heroines, this cover stands apart through pure elegance. The Regency romance reader recognizes the visual language instantly: the silhouette profiles, the cameo format, the emerald-and-gold palette all signal "historical romance" with sophistication.

At thumbnail, the gold oval cameo on dark green is immediately elegant and distinctive. The two-profile composition is readable even at small scale. At full resolution, the cameo's shell-pink translucency, the precise silhouette edges, and the gold frame's metallic dimensionality are exquisite.

THIS IS REGENCY-ERA DECORATIVE DESIGN. Cameo silhouettes, gold foil, jewel-toned silk, classical ornamentation. The beauty is in the restraint — two profiles, one wager, and the electric space between them.
