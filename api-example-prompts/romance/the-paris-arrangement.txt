---

A beautiful, soft, dreamy book cover that looks like a still frame from a romantic film — shot on location in Paris with a vintage lens that turns everything into a gentle, warm blur of color and light. The aesthetic is modern romantic photography with a deliberate pastel color grade: every color has been shifted toward warm pink and soft gold, every highlight blooms with gentle lens flare, and the shallow depth-of-field turns the background into a painterly wash of bokeh light. This is NOT sharp, NOT gritty, NOT dramatic — it is soft, warm, and unapologetically romantic.

THE SCENE — A COUPLE ON A PARISIAN BRIDGE AT GOLDEN HOUR:

The setting is the Pont des Arts (or a bridge very like it) — a pedestrian bridge over the Seine in Paris, captured during the golden hour just before sunset. The camera is positioned at one end of the bridge, looking along its length, with the couple in the mid-ground and the Parisian skyline soft in the background.

THE COUPLE (center, 40-75% from top, slightly soft-focus):

Two people stand close together at the bridge railing, their bodies turned toward each other in the intimate geometry of new love — faces close, foreheads almost touching, his hands on her waist, her hand on his chest. They are rendered in SLIGHT soft focus — not blurry, but with the gentle softness of a portrait lens at wide aperture. Their features are visible but idealized by the soft rendering.

HE: A tall man of Brazilian-Portuguese descent in his early 30s, with warm brown skin, dark wavy hair that catches the golden light, and a close-trimmed beard. He wears a simple white linen button-down shirt with the sleeves rolled to his forearms and dark navy trousers — elegant but effortless. The golden hour light catches the white linen and turns it warm cream-gold.

SHE: A woman of Korean-American descent in her late 20s, with shoulder-length black hair that the golden light edges with warm amber highlights. She wears a simple sundress in soft dusty rose (#D4A0A0) — the kind of dress that moves in a breeze. A light cardigan in cream hangs from her shoulders. She is slightly shorter than him, looking up; he looks down at her. Neither is smiling broadly — the expression is the quiet, loaded look of two people who are about to kiss but haven't yet.

The couple is the emotional center but NOT the sharpest element — the bridge railing and a nearby lamppost are in sharper focus (the characteristic look of a wide-aperture lens where the focus plane falls slightly in front of or behind the main subject, a deliberate artistic choice).

THE BRIDGE AND FOREGROUND:

The bridge railing is elegant wrought iron, painted a warm dark green that the golden light turns almost bronze. A vintage-style Parisian lamppost rises in the left foreground — ornate, iron, with a glass globe lamp that is just beginning to glow a soft warm amber as evening approaches. Scattered on the bridge railing, small details: a paper coffee cup, a folded newspaper, a single red rose lying on the railing near the couple — the rose is the sharpest, most saturated element in the foreground, a vivid pop of true red (#CC2020) against the otherwise pastel color palette.

THE BACKGROUND — PARIS IN BOKEH:

Behind the couple, the Parisian skyline is rendered in beautiful, creamy bokeh — the characteristic circular blur of out-of-focus highlights from a wide-aperture lens. The recognizable silhouette of Notre-Dame (or a similar Gothic cathedral) is faintly visible as a dark shape against the golden sky, its details dissolved into soft blur. The Seine reflects the golden sky as a wide band of warm, shimmering light — each ripple creating a small bokeh circle. Trees along the riverbank are masses of soft, warm green-gold blur. Other pedestrians on the bridge are reduced to soft, warm shapes — indistinct figures that add life without competing with the couple.

The most magical element: the golden hour sunlight creates hundreds of tiny bokeh circles where it catches leaves, water ripples, and distant windows — each one a small, perfect circle of warm gold or soft pink, floating in the blurred background like luminous confetti.

LENS FLARE AND LIGHT EFFECTS:

The golden hour sun (low, to the right, partially behind a building) creates several deliberate lens effects:
- A warm, golden lens flare streaks diagonally across the upper-right portion of the image — a soft, elongated hexagonal flare shape in warm gold and pale pink
- The overall image has a subtle warm haze — the characteristic light scatter of shooting into the sun with a vintage lens, which lifts the shadows and adds a warm, milky quality to the entire image
- Rim lighting on both figures — the sun behind and to their right creates a warm golden edge-light on their hair, shoulders, and the outlines of their bodies, separating them from the background with a glowing contour

COLOR GRADE — ROMANTIC PASTEL:

The entire image has been color-graded with a deliberate romantic pastel palette:
- Highlights shifted toward warm pink (#FFE0D0)
- Shadows lifted and shifted toward warm lavender (#C0A8C0)
- Midtones warmed to golden (#FFE8C0)
- Overall saturation reduced by 20% from reality — colors are soft, not vivid
- Exception: the single red rose retains full saturation as the cover's color anchor
- The overall impression is of a world seen through rose-tinted glasses — literally

The specific color values:
- Golden hour gold: #FFD080 — dominant light color
- Dusty rose: #D4A0A0 — her dress, the pink shift in highlights
- Warm cream: #FFF0D8 — his shirt, lamppost glow, paper whites
- Soft lavender shadow: #C0A8C0 — lifted shadows
- Seine reflection gold: #E8C870 — water highlights
- True red rose: #CC2020 — the single saturated accent
- Bokeh circles: #FFE080 (gold) and #FFC0C0 (pink) at various opacities

TEXT — CLEAN, MODERN, ROMANTIC:

Title (positioned at 6-20% from top, centered over the soft golden sky):
"the paris" — in a clean, modern, thin sans-serif font (think Josefin Sans Light or Quicksand Light) in warm cream white (#FFF0D8). All LOWERCASE — deliberately casual, modern, intimate. Medium-large, letter-spacing 0.2em. The lowercase treatment signals "contemporary romance" to genre readers instantly.
"arrangement" — on the next line, same font, same size, same color, same lowercase. The two-line title is clean and balanced.

Subtitle (positioned at 22% from top, centered): "a novel" — in the same font, even smaller, same color, all lowercase, letter-spacing 0.4em. Minimal and understated.

Author name (positioned at 89-92% from top, centered): "JI-YEON SANTOS-PARK" — in the same thin sans-serif, small, in warm cream (#FFF0D8), all lowercase, letter-spacing 0.3em. Consistent with the title's casual, modern treatment.

OVERALL MOOD:

Warm, dreamy, heart-fluttering — the feeling of the moment just before a first kiss on a bridge in Paris at sunset, when the whole world goes soft and golden and the only sharp thing is the beating of your heart. The soft focus and pastel color grade create a visual equivalent of falling in love — the world becomes more beautiful, softer, warmer, and slightly unreal.

At thumbnail, the golden light, the soft couple silhouette, and the pink-cream palette instantly signal "contemporary romance" to genre readers. At full resolution, the bokeh circles, the lens flare, the single red rose, and the intimate body language of the couple are beautiful.

THIS IS ROMANTIC SOFT-FOCUS PHOTOGRAPHY. Shallow depth-of-field, golden hour light, pastel color grade. The beauty is in the softness — the way a vintage lens and the right light can make an ordinary moment look like the beginning of the best love story ever told.
