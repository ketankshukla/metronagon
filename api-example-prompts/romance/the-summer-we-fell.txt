---

A luminous, sun-drenched book cover rendered in the Impressionist painting tradition — loose, confident brushstrokes that capture the essence of light, color, and warmth rather than photographic detail. The scene is a Mediterranean beach at midday, and the true subject is not the beach but the LIGHT — the way brilliant summer sun transforms water into liquid jewels, sand into warm gold, and shadows into pools of cool violet. Every surface shimmers with the broken, dappled quality of Impressionist color — no area is a single flat tone; everything is built from small, distinct brushstrokes of multiple colors placed side by side, mixing in the eye rather than on the canvas.

THE SCENE — A MEDITERRANEAN BEACH AT MIDDAY:

A sun-drenched coastal scene — a small crescent beach with turquoise water, warm sand, and a single figure seen from behind, walking into the surf. The composition is simple and horizontal in feel despite the portrait format: broad bands of sky, sea, and sand stacked vertically, unified by the warm golden light that saturates everything.

THE SEA (30-55% from top): The Mediterranean sea fills the middle band of the image — painted in the Impressionist manner with dozens of distinct color strokes laid side by side:
- Deep turquoise (#008080) for the deeper water further from shore
- Bright cerulean blue (#0080C0) for the mid-distance
- Pale aquamarine (#80E0D0) for the shallow water near the beach
- Brilliant white (#FFFFFF) and pale yellow (#FFF8D0) for the sun-sparkle on the wave crests — small, dashing horizontal strokes that capture the instant flash of sunlight on moving water
- Deep ultramarine (#1A3A8B) and cool violet (#5A3A8B) in the wave shadows and troughs
The water is NOT smoothly blended — each color exists as a distinct, visible brushstroke, and the variety of colors within the "blue" water is extraordinary. This is the Impressionist revelation: water is not one color but fifty colors, constantly shifting.

Small waves break on the shore — rendered as horizontal lines of foam-white with turquoise and sand-gold reflections. The breaking waves are painted with quick, energetic strokes — the foam is thick impasto white paint, built up physically on the surface.

THE BEACH (55-85% from top): Warm sand fills the lower portion — painted not as uniform beige but as a rich tapestry of warm tones: pale gold (#E8D0A0), warm ochre (#D0A860), cool violet shadows (#A090B0) where the wet sand reflects the sky, and bright cream-white (#FFF8E0) where the sun hits directly. The sand near the water is darker and reflective — a mirror-like wet surface that reflects the turquoise sea and the golden sky in broad, loose strokes.

THE FIGURE (center, approximately 60-80% from top): A single person walks INTO the sea, seen from behind — we see their back, their legs entering the surf, their arms slightly out for balance as they wade into the shallow water. The figure is rendered with Impressionist looseness: a few bold strokes of warm skin tone (#D0A080), a splash of vivid coral-red (#FF6040) for a sundress or sarong caught by the breeze, and dark brown strokes for hair lifted by the wind. The figure is NOT detailed — it is an impression, a gesture, a few confident brushmarks that suggest a person in motion. The anonymity is intentional: this could be anyone walking into the sea on a perfect summer day.

The figure's feet create small splashes where they meet the water — bright white droplets caught mid-air, each one a single stroke of thick white paint.

THE SKY (top 30%): A brilliant Mediterranean sky — the kind of depthless, pure blue that exists only at the southern edge of Europe in midsummer. Painted in broad, sweeping strokes of cerulean (#0080C0), cobalt (#2040A0), and pale sky blue (#80C0F0), with the horizon area lightening to warm white-gold (#FFF0D0) where the sky meets the sea-haze. A few wispy clouds are suggested with thin, dry-brush strokes of warm white.

IMPRESSIONIST TECHNIQUE:

The painting must show authentic Impressionist characteristics:
- BROKEN COLOR: No area is a single tone — everything is built from small, distinct strokes of different colors placed side by side. The sand is twenty shades of gold and violet. The sea is thirty shades of blue and green. The sky has pink and yellow hidden in its blue.
- VISIBLE BRUSHSTROKES: Every stroke is visible — short, confident, directional. Horizontal strokes for the sea surface. Dabbing strokes for the sand texture. Long sweeping strokes for the sky. The brushwork is the texture.
- COMPLEMENTARY SHADOWS: Shadows are NOT grey or black — they are painted in the complementary color of the lit surface. Sand shadows are cool violet. Water shadows are warm orange. Sky shadows are pale pink.
- LIGHT AS SUBJECT: The painting is fundamentally about LIGHT — the way it transforms surfaces, creates color relationships, and makes the ordinary (a beach, water, sand) extraordinary.
- THICK PAINT: Highlights are built up in thick impasto — the white foam, the sun-sparkle on water, the brightest sand — these areas would be physically raised if this were a real painting.

TEXT — LIGHT AND SUMMERY:

Title (positioned at 5-18% from top, centered over the bright sky):
"the summer" — in a light, airy serif font (think Cormorant Garamond Light or Libre Baskerville Light) in warm white (#FFF0D8), all lowercase. Medium-large, letter-spacing 0.15em. The warm white sits beautifully against the blue sky.
"we fell" — on the next line, same font, same size, in coral red (#FF6040) — the same color as the figure's garment below. The warm red against the cool blue sky creates the cover's primary color tension. All lowercase, maintaining the casual, intimate tone.

Subtitle (positioned at 20% from top, centered): "a novel" — tiny, thin sans-serif in warm white (#FFF0D8), all lowercase, letter-spacing 0.4em.

Author name (positioned at 88-91% from top, centered over the warm sand): "MARINA COSTA-ABAYOMI" — in light serif capitals in warm white (#FFF0D8), letter-spacing 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Sun-drenched, nostalgic, bittersweet — the feeling of a perfect summer day that you know, even as you live it, will become a memory you carry forever. The Impressionist technique adds a quality of fading — the loose brushstrokes and broken color suggest a scene that is already becoming a memory, already dissolving into light and color. The figure walking into the sea could be arriving at joy or leaving it behind.

At thumbnail, the bold turquoise-and-gold color blocked composition with the small coral figure is instantly appealing and readable as "beach romance." At full resolution, the Impressionist brushwork — the broken color in the water, the violet sand shadows, the thick white foam impasto — is museum-quality.

THIS IS IMPRESSIONIST BEACH PAINTING. Broken color, visible brushstrokes, light as subject. The beauty is in the shimmer — the way a hundred small brushstrokes of different colors create, when viewed together, the overwhelming sensation of warmth, light, and summer.
