---

A full-cover illustration rendered in the style of classic 1970s science fiction paperback cover art — the kind of bold, slightly exaggerated, gorgeously painted covers created by artists like Chris Foss, Peter Andrew Jones, John Berkey, and Frank Frazetta's space work. This is NOT modern digital art — it must look like a hand-painted gouache and airbrush illustration from 1977, reproduced on slightly yellowed paperback stock. The entire image should have the warm, analog quality of pre-digital illustration: visible paint texture, soft airbrush gradients, bold opaque color areas, and the slight oversaturation and warmth of 1970s printing on cheap pulp paper. Apply a subtle overall film grain texture and the faintest yellowing at the edges, as though this cover has been sitting on a used bookstore shelf for 45 years.

THE SCENE — A CHAOTIC SPACE BATTLE WITH MULTIPLE ELEMENTS:

This is NOT a single-character portrait — it is a busy, action-packed, multi-element composition crammed with the gleeful maximalism of 1970s pulp sci-fi. The composition is diagonal and dynamic, with elements arranged along a sweeping diagonal line from lower-left to upper-right, creating a sense of explosive forward motion.

THE SPACESHIP (DOMINANT ELEMENT, 30-70% OF IMAGE):

Dominating the center of the image, a massive spacecraft flies at an aggressive diagonal angle — nose pointed toward the upper-right, engines blazing toward the lower-left. This ship is rendered in the Chris Foss style: enormous, industrial, asymmetrical, and covered in bold geometric color panels. The hull is NOT sleek and Apple-designed — it is chunky, mechanical, bristling with antenna arrays, sensor dishes, gun turrets, and exposed mechanical systems. The hull coloring is the most distinctive element: large flat panels of bright burnt orange (#CC5500) and avocado green (#568203) separated by black panel lines and yellow hazard stripes — the unmistakable Chris Foss color language. Some panels are pristine, others are scorched, dented, and patched with mismatched metal plates. The ship's name "STARDRIFT VII" is stenciled on the hull in blocky military-style yellow text, partially obscured by blast damage. The engine section at the rear erupts with a massive plume of blue-white thrust plasma, painted in layered airbrush gradients from blinding white at the nozzle to deep cobalt blue at the edges, the plasma trail streaking across the lower-left corner of the image in a sweeping curve.

SECONDARY SHIPS AND COMBAT:

Behind and around the main ship, a space battle is raging. Three smaller attack craft — sleek, angular, painted in menacing deep red and gunmetal grey — are in pursuit, arranged in a triangular formation. Each one trails thin streams of orange-red weapons fire (painted as solid bright lines in the 1970s style, not realistic beam effects). Two of the weapons streams narrowly miss the main ship, one striking its aft section and creating a small explosion rendered as a bright white starburst with orange and yellow radiating streaks — painted in the bold, graphic style of 1970s space battle art. In the far background, a larger capital ship is visible — a massive, cathedral-like dreadnought painted in dark purple-grey, bristling with hundreds of tiny light points, rendered at a scale that makes the foreground ships look like insects. This dreadnought is partially obscured by the curvature of a planet below.

THE PLANET:

The lower-right portion of the image is dominated by the curved horizon of a gas giant planet — an enormous, banded world in swirling layers of deep amber, burnt sienna, rust red, and pale cream. The bands are painted in sweeping, flowing brushstrokes that suggest massive atmospheric storms. A single enormous storm eye — like Jupiter's Great Red Spot — is visible near the planet's limb, rendered as a tight spiral of dark red and cream. The planet's atmosphere catches the light of a nearby sun (out of frame to the upper-right), creating a bright atmospheric glow along the planet's limb — a crescent of brilliant white-gold light that separates the planet from the deep space background.

THE FIGURES — SMALL BUT PRESENT:

In the lower-left corner of the image, visible through a large viewport window on the main ship's bridge, TWO FIGURES are visible — small, only about 5% of the image height, but rendered with enough detail to be distinct:

CAPTAIN RENKO: A stocky, broad-shouldered man in his 50s with a grey crew cut and a jaw like a brick, wearing a battered orange flight suit with mission patches. He is gripping the edge of a console, leaning forward, barking an order. His face is lit by the orange glow of console screens.

THE NAVIGATOR: A tall, thin woman with close-cropped silver hair and dark brown skin, seated at the navigation console, her hands flying across holographic controls rendered as small dots and lines of green light. She is calm where he is intense — the competence behind the bluster.

These figures are NOT the focus of the cover — they are a detail that rewards close inspection, adding human scale to the massive machinery around them.

DEEP SPACE BACKGROUND:

The background beyond the ships and planet is deep space — not empty black, but the rich, warm, slightly purple-tinted space of 1970s sci-fi art. A dense field of stars is rendered as tiny dots and crosses (the characteristic four-pointed star rendering of 1970s space art, painted with a fine brush). A distant nebula cloud fills the upper-left corner — painted in soft airbrush gradients of warm pink, pale lavender, and deep purple, like a cosmic watercolor. The nebula is not the focus — it provides color and depth to the background.

COLOR PALETTE — DISTINCTLY 1970s:

The overall palette is warm and analog — burnt orange, avocado green, mustard yellow, rust red, deep brown, cobalt blue, warm purple, cream white. These are NOT modern saturated digital colors — they are the slightly muted, warm-shifted colors of 1970s gouache and airbrush illustration, reproduced on paper that has yellowed with age. The black areas are not true black — they are very dark warm brown (#1A1209), giving the entire image a vintage warmth. Highlights are not pure white — they are warm cream (#FFF8E7). The overall impression is of a beautifully painted image seen through a filter of warm nostalgia.

TEXT — RETRO 1970s PAPERBACK TYPOGRAPHY, COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER COVER:

Price badge (positioned at 2-4% from top, LEFT-aligned, approximately 8% from left edge): A small rectangular badge with rounded corners, filled with a solid warm mustard yellow (#D4A017). Inside the badge, in tiny bold black text: "$1.95" — because every proper 1970s paperback had a price in the corner. Below the price: "SCIENCE FICTION" in even tinier black text within the badge.

Publisher logo (positioned at 2-4% from top, RIGHT-aligned, approximately 8% from right edge): A small circular logo in bright orange — a simple geometric design suggesting a stylized planet with a ring, with tiny text reading "NOVA PRESS" curving around the inside of the circle. This is a fictional publisher logo in the style of the DAW or Ace logos from the era.

Title (positioned at 6-20% from top, centered):
"STARDRIFT" — rendered in a massive retro display font that screams 1970s: think ITC Busorama, Pump, or Bauhaus 93 — rounded, chunky, geometric letterforms with thick strokes and exaggerated curves. The font color is bright chrome yellow (#FFD700) with a dark orange (#CC5500) drop shadow offset 3 pixels down and right — classic pulp paperback title treatment. The letters are large enough to span nearly the full width of the cover.
"SEVEN" — rendered directly beneath "STARDRIFT" in a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT font: a thin, angular, futuristic stencil font (think Eurostile Extended or Microgramma Bold Extended) in bright white with the same dark orange drop shadow. The contrast between the chunky rounded "STARDRIFT" and the angular mechanical "SEVEN" creates visual interest.

Tagline (positioned at 22-24% from top, centered): "The galaxy's last freelance crew. The universe's worst luck." — rendered in a small italic serif font (Times-style) in pale cream (#FFF8E7), the text justified to a narrow column width. This is the classic paperback tagline treatment — small, readable, promising adventure.

Series indicator (positioned at 25% from top, centered): "A Captain Renko Adventure — Volume VII" — in very small sans-serif text in warm mustard yellow (#D4A017), letter-spacing 0.1em.

Author name (positioned at 88-92% from top, centered): "FRANK CASTELLANO" — in a bold, wide sans-serif font (think Futura Bold or Avant Garde Gothic Bold) in bright white (#FFF8E7) with generous letter-spacing (0.2em). Below the author name, in much smaller italic serif text in pale yellow: "Author of BURNGATE STATION and THE IRON NEBULA" — because 1970s paperbacks ALWAYS credited the author's other works.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Thrilling, nostalgic, kinetic — the feeling of grabbing a dog-eared paperback off a spinning rack at a drugstore in 1977 and knowing from the cover alone that you're in for a wild ride. The cover is busy, colorful, action-packed, and unabashedly fun. It does not take itself too seriously — this is space adventure, not literary fiction, and the cover celebrates that with maximal energy and warm retro charm. The warm analog palette, the visible paint textures, the chunky retro fonts, and the classic multi-element action composition make this cover look COMPLETELY different from every other cover in this set.

THIS IS RETRO ILLUSTRATION. It must look PAINTED — visible gouache texture, airbrush gradients, fine brush detail work. It should feel like you could smell the yellowed paper. NOT photorealistic, NOT digitally clean, NOT modern. 1970s analog warmth and bold pulp energy.
