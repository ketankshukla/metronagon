SUBJECT — A WARRIOR-KING STANDING BEFORE HIS THRONE:

A powerful man of West African descent in his mid-30s, positioned in the lower-center of the image, standing with commanding presence. He is tall and broad-shouldered, captured in a heroic three-quarter pose facing slightly right, his weight planted firmly, chin raised with quiet authority. He wears magnificent armor that fuses medieval plate design with African sculptural aesthetics — the breastplate is forged from a dark bronze alloy with a deep green patina, embossed with intricate geometric patterns inspired by Benin bronze reliefs. The armor plates are layered and organic, shaped like overlapping leaves and scales, each edge trimmed with bright gold filigree depicting intertwined vines and lions. Over his shoulders, a grand cape of deep emerald-green velvet cascades to the floor, clasped at each shoulder by golden lion-head brooches with tiny emerald eyes. The cape's underside is visible where it drapes — rich gold silk embroidered with a repeating pattern of crowned lions.

He holds a magnificent war-staff in his right hand — a seven-foot weapon of dark ironwood capped with a massive emerald crystal the size of a fist, the crystal radiating soft green light that illuminates his face from below. The crystal is faceted and internally cracked, with veins of gold running through it like frozen lightning. His left hand rests on the pommel of a sheathed longsword at his hip — the scabbard wrapped in dark green leather tooled with gold vine patterns.

FACE — REGAL PHOTOREALISTIC DETAIL:

His face commands absolute attention. Rich dark brown skin with warm undertones that catch the green and gold light beautifully — visible pores, the texture of real skin, a thin sheen of determination across his brow. His bone structure is magnificent — strong, square jaw, high prominent cheekbones, a broad noble forehead. His eyes are deep brown, nearly black, with extraordinary depth and intelligence — the eyes of a man who has studied war and philosophy in equal measure. Gold-green reflections from the emerald crystal dance in his irises. His nose is broad and strong, his lips full and set in a line of resolute calm. He wears a close-cropped beard, meticulously shaped, with a few strands of silver at the chin — not age, but the mark of the emerald throne's power. His hair is cropped short with a precise fade, and atop his head sits a crown — not gaudy, but elegant: a circlet of dark bronze set with seven emeralds of descending size, the central stone catching the light with an internal fire.

BACKGROUND — THE EMERALD THRONE ROOM IN A LIVING PALACE:

Behind him rises the Emerald Throne itself — an enormous seat carved from a single massive emerald crystal, veined with gold, grown rather than built. It rises fifteen feet high, its back shaped like an unfurling canopy of crystallized leaves. The throne room is extraordinary — the walls are living stone intertwined with enormous ancient trees whose roots form the pillars and whose canopy forms the ceiling far above. Bioluminescent moss and vines climb every surface, emitting soft green-gold light. The floor is polished dark stone with veins of emerald running through it like rivers seen from above. Shafts of golden sunlight stream through gaps in the living canopy ceiling, creating dramatic god-rays that cut through the green-tinged air. In the distance, through massive arched windows, a vast kingdom of rolling green hills and distant mountains is visible under a dramatic sky of gold and deep blue.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

The scene is saturated with green and gold light. Emerald-colored particles of magical energy drift slowly upward from the throne and the crystal staff, like luminous spores or fireflies. Golden sunbeams intersect with the green bioluminescence creating complex, layered lighting across every surface. Fine mist hangs in the air at floor level, catching the light and creating soft halos around the base of the throne. The overall palette is deep emerald green, rich gold, dark bronze, and warm amber, with accents of deep blue in the shadows.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

His face occupies roughly the 50%-68% vertical zone. The top 40% contains only the upper throne room — canopy ceiling, god-rays, living stone architecture. No part of his face or body enters the top 35%.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:

OVERALL MOOD:

Majestic, verdant, powerful — the feeling of standing in the presence of a king whose power comes not from conquest but from the living earth itself. The dominant palette of emerald and gold creates a unique visual identity that stands apart from the typical dark-and-fire fantasy covers. Stunning at thumbnail (the green-gold palette is immediately distinctive) and breathtaking at full resolution.
