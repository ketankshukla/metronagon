---

A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic book cover rendered at 1024x1536 pixels in sharp cinematic digital style with warm golden-hour natural lighting and intimate depth-of-field. This must look like a frame from a Terrence Malick or Sofia Coppola film — poetic, contemplative, achingly beautiful in its simplicity. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly brushstrokes, NO soft-focus artistic filters. Every pixel must be razor-sharp where in focus and have natural photographic bokeh where out of focus.

SUBJECT — A WOMAN SITTING ALONE AT A KITCHEN TABLE:

A woman of mixed-race descent (Black and Irish) in her early 40s, positioned in the lower-center of the image, sitting at a small wooden kitchen table in a sun-drenched room. She is captured in a contemplative moment — her body angled slightly to the left, one elbow on the table, her chin resting lightly on her knuckles, gazing out a window to her left (out of frame). The light from the window floods across her face and the table in warm golden bars, creating a dramatic pattern of light and shadow through what must be venetian blinds. She wears a simple cream-white linen button-down shirt, the sleeves rolled to her forearms, the fabric catching the golden light beautifully. Her other hand rests flat on the table beside a ceramic coffee mug — pale blue, slightly chipped at the rim, steam rising in a delicate curl that catches the golden light. A folded newspaper sits on the table, and a pair of reading glasses rests atop it. The table is old, honey-colored pine with visible grain and the patina of decades of use — nicks, ring stains, a child's scratch mark partially sanded away.

FACE — INTIMATE PHOTOREALISTIC BEAUTY:

Her face is the emotional core of the image. Her skin is a warm medium-brown — a beautiful blend of her heritage — with golden undertones that the sunlight turns luminous. Freckles are scattered across her nose and cheekbones — real, natural freckles, each individually rendered, some darker than others. Fine lines at the corners of her eyes — laugh lines that also tell of worry, of sleepless nights, of forty years of living fully. Her eyes are hazel-green — extraordinary in the golden light, almost amber where the sunbeam catches them, with a depth of emotion that is impossible to name but impossible to look away from. She is not crying, not smiling — her expression is that quiet, loaded stillness of someone who is deciding something enormous while appearing to think about nothing at all. Her lips are naturally tinted, neither smiling nor frowning — neutral in the most powerful sense of the word. Her hair is natural — a beautiful halo of dark brown tight curls with auburn highlights lit golden by the sun, shoulder-length, a few strands falling forward to frame her face. One curl catches the light and seems to glow with warm amber fire.

BACKGROUND — A SMALL, LIVED-IN KITCHEN IN MORNING LIGHT:

The background is shallow depth-of-field (beautifully blurred, natural bokeh) but the shapes are recognizable — a modest kitchen in a small American home. Blurred warm tones of honey-colored cabinets, a window with thin white curtains that diffuse the morning light into soft golden warmth, the edge of a refrigerator with blurred shapes that suggest children's artwork held by magnets. On the counter behind her, blurred shapes of everyday objects — a fruit bowl with warm orange and yellow tones, a stack of mail, a small potted plant. Everything is warm, real, and slightly worn — this is not a catalog kitchen, it is a kitchen where a family lives, where coffee is made at 6 AM, where homework is checked, where a woman sits after everyone else has left and lets the weight of the quiet settle on her shoulders.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Golden morning light is everything in this image. It streams from the left, creating long warm shadows and bars of golden illumination across the table, the coffee mug, and her face. Dust motes float in the shafts of light — tiny golden particles suspended in air, each one catching the sun like a miniature star. The steam from the coffee mug rises in a thin, delicate spiral, backlit by the golden light into a translucent ribbon. The overall palette is warm gold, honey amber, cream white, soft brown, and muted sage green — everything bathed in that specific quality of morning light that makes ordinary objects look like sacred things.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Her face occupies roughly the 55%-72% vertical zone. The top 40% contains only the upper kitchen — blurred cabinets, the top of the window, golden light, dust motes. No part of her face or body enters the top 35%.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:

Line 1 (exactly 4% from top): "A NOVEL" — small, refined serif font (Garamond style), centered, warm gold color (#C8A961), letter-spacing 0.3em, approximately 12pt. Understated and quiet.

Lines 2-3 (title block, exactly 10-24% from top): "THE WEIGHT OF SUNDAYS" — elegant serif font, centered, dark charcoal (#2C2C2C) with a very subtle warm gold tint where the golden light would hit the letters. "THE WEIGHT OF" on one line, smaller. "SUNDAYS" on the next line, significantly larger — the word itself carries visual weight. The letters are clean, refined, literary — no glow, no effects, just beautiful typography.

Line 4 (exactly 27% from top): A thin horizontal line in warm gold, simple, centered, width 30% of image.

Line 5 (exactly 92% from top): "RUTH MCALISTER" — elegant serif font, centered, dark charcoal (#2C2C2C), letter-spacing 0.2em. Quiet and dignified.

OVERALL MOOD:

Intimate, contemplative, achingly human — the feeling of a Sunday morning when everyone else has left the house and the silence becomes a living thing. This is not an action cover or a genre cover — it is a portrait of a moment, the kind of image that makes a literary reader think "I know this feeling." The restraint is the power — no drama, no spectacle, just light and a woman and the weight of an ordinary extraordinary life. At thumbnail, the warm golden light and the intimate composition create immediate emotional pull.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting texture. NO watercolor. NO canvas grain. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — warm, sharp, intimate.
