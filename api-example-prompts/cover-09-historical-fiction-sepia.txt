---

A rich, sumptuous oil painting rendered with the technical mastery of a 17th-century Dutch Golden Age master. This image MUST look like an actual oil painting — visible brushstrokes in every area, thick impasto texture on highlights where paint was built up in layers, the subtle weave of canvas showing through in thinner passages, the warm amber glow of aged varnish over the entire surface. The painting style draws from Caravaggio's theatrical chiaroscuro, Rembrandt's warm humanity, and the candlelit intimacy of Georges de La Tour. This is the OPPOSITE of photorealism — it is painterly, textural, and warmly human in its rendering. Every face has character, every surface has brushwork, every shadow glows with reflected color.

THE SCENE — A CROWDED TAVERN AT NIGHT, LIT BY A SINGLE CANDLE:

The painting depicts the interior of a 17th-century Dutch tavern — a low-ceilinged, wood-beamed room packed with EIGHT distinct characters gathered around a heavy oak table, caught in a moment of dramatic tension. This is a CROWD SCENE — not a single-character portrait. The composition is modeled on the great Dutch group paintings: Rembrandt's "The Night Watch," Caravaggio's "The Calling of Saint Matthew," and Vermeer's interior scenes, adapted to a tavern setting crackling with intrigue.

THE LIGHT SOURCE — A SINGLE CANDLE:

A single fat tallow candle sits on the center of the oak table, its flame the painting's only light source. The candle is rendered with exquisite detail — the flame itself painted in layered strokes of cadmium yellow, Naples yellow, and a core of near-white, the flame shape slightly blurred as though caught mid-flicker. Hot wax drips down the candle's sides in thick rivulets. The candlelight illuminates the nearest faces and hands with warm golden-amber light while everything beyond arm's reach falls into deep, velvety shadow. The chiaroscuro is extreme — the contrast between the lit areas and the shadows is dramatic, theatrical, and beautiful.

THE EIGHT CHARACTERS (ARRANGED AROUND THE TABLE):

CHARACTER 1 — THE MERCHANT (center-left, facing the viewer, the painting's focal point): A large, prosperous man of Flemish descent in his 50s with a florid face, double chin, and shrewd small eyes that catch the candlelight. He wears a rich doublet of deep burgundy velvet with gold buttons, a wide white linen collar (the characteristic Dutch ruff, slightly wilted and wine-stained). One meaty hand rests flat on the table beside a leather-bound ledger; the other grips a pewter goblet of dark red wine, tilted slightly, about to spill. His face is lit fully by the candle — every pore, every vein in his flushed cheeks, the sheen of sweat on his forehead, all rendered in rich oil-paint detail with visible brushstrokes building up the flesh tones in layers of pink, ochre, and warm white.

CHARACTER 2 — THE PICKPOCKET (to the merchant's left, in shadow): A young woman of indeterminate origin — could be Romani, could be Moorish, could be anything — barely visible in the deep shadow. Only half her face catches the candlelight: one eye, dark and alert, gleams from the darkness. Her hand — the only fully lit part of her body — is reaching toward the merchant's coin purse beneath the table, fingers extended with delicate precision. She wears a dark cloak with the hood up. The contrast between her shadowed body and her illuminated, outstretched hand is pure Caravaggio.

CHARACTER 3 — THE SOLDIER (far left, partially cut off by the painting's edge): A scarred, weathered man in his 40s with a military bearing, wearing a battered steel breastplate over a dirty linen shirt. His face is in three-quarter profile, turned toward the merchant with an expression of barely concealed contempt. A long clay pipe clenches between his teeth, a thin wisp of smoke rising into the darkness above. Only the right side of his face catches the candlelight — the left is lost in shadow, except for the glint of a scar running from his temple to his jaw.

CHARACTER 4 — THE PRIEST (center-right, directly across from the merchant): An elderly man in austere black clerical robes with a white collar. Gaunt, ascetic face with hollow cheeks and deep-set eyes that burn with moral intensity in the candlelight. His bony hands are folded on the table in front of him — no food, no drink before him, only a small leather-bound Bible. He watches the merchant with the patience of a man who believes divine judgment is always coming. His face is painted in cool tones — less warm than the merchant's flushed complexion, suggesting spiritual austerity.

CHARACTER 5 — THE BARMAID (standing behind the table, between characters): A stout woman in her 30s of Dutch descent, ruddy-cheeked and strong-armed, in the process of placing a large ceramic jug of ale on the table. She leans forward, and the candlelight catches the underside of her face and her white linen blouse, creating dramatic uplighting. She is the only character in motion — her body has the slight blur of movement rendered in looser, more energetic brushstrokes.

CHARACTER 6 — THE SPY (far right, almost entirely in shadow): A thin, elegant figure of ambiguous gender, wearing a dark blue velvet coat with silver buttons. Only their hands are fully visible — long, pale fingers wrapped around a sealed letter with a red wax seal. The letter is being passed UNDER the table toward the merchant. The spy's face is almost entirely in shadow — only the tip of a sharp nose and the glint of one eye catch the faintest reflected candlelight.

CHARACTER 7 — THE DRUNK (lower-right, slumped against the table): A young man passed out face-down on the table, one arm dangling, a toppled wine cup beside his head, a dark puddle of spilled wine spreading across the wood. His curly brown hair is rendered in loose, playful brushstrokes. He serves as comic relief and a compositional anchor in the lower-right.

CHARACTER 8 — THE DOG (under the table, lower-center): A scruffy brown terrier, only partially visible beneath the tablecloth, gnawing on a bone with single-minded intensity. The dog is painted with affectionate detail — the warm brown fur rendered in short, directional brushstrokes, the wet nose catching a pinpoint of candlelight. Every great Dutch Golden Age painting has a dog.

THE TABLE AND STILL LIFE ELEMENTS:

The oak table is a rich still life in itself — painted with the obsessive detail of a Dutch vanitas painting:
- The leather-bound ledger with brass clasps, pages edged with gold leaf, ink stains on the cover
- Two pewter plates with the remnants of a meal — bread crusts, cheese rinds, a picked-over chicken leg
- The ceramic ale jug, glazed in warm brown and cream, reflecting the candlelight on its curved surface
- A small pile of gold coins scattered beside the ledger — each coin individually painted with highlights and shadow
- A half-eaten apple turning brown — a vanitas symbol of mortality and decay
- The toppled wine cup and spreading wine puddle — the wine rendered in translucent glazes of deep alizarin crimson over dark umber

THE ROOM:

The tavern room is suggested rather than detailed — deep shadows with the barest hints of background elements: the vertical lines of wood-paneled walls, the shape of a barrel in the far corner, the warm amber glow of a distant hearth fire reflecting on the ceiling beams. The ceiling itself is low, dark, with heavy oak beams disappearing into shadow. A single small window at the far end shows a sliver of deep blue night sky with a crescent moon — the only cool color in the entire painting.

PAINTING TECHNIQUE AND TEXTURE:

This MUST look like a real oil painting:
- Visible brushstrokes throughout — short, confident strokes building up form in the lit areas; longer, looser strokes in the shadows
- Thick impasto on highlights — the candle flame, the gold coins, the pewter reflections, the white collar — where paint was physically built up to catch real light
- Transparent glazes in the shadows — the dark areas should feel deep and luminous, not flat black, because they are built from transparent layers of raw umber, burnt sienna, and lamp black over a warm ground
- Canvas texture visible throughout, especially in the thinner passages and the dark background areas where the canvas weave shows through
- The warm yellow-amber cast of aged varnish over the entire painting, slightly darkening and warming every color
- A few tiny craquelure lines (the fine cracking pattern of aged oil paint) visible in the lighter areas — suggesting this painting is centuries old

COLOR PALETTE — OLD MASTER WARMTH:

The palette is strictly limited to colors available to 17th-century Dutch painters:
- Naples yellow and cadmium yellow: candle flame, gold coins, lit skin highlights
- Yellow ochre and raw sienna: skin base tones, wood, bread
- Burnt sienna and burnt umber: shadows, wood grain, warm transitions
- Raw umber: deepest shadows, background
- Alizarin crimson: wine, burgundy velvet, flushed skin
- Lead white (warm white, slightly yellow): linen, candle wax, eye highlights
- Lamp black: darkest accents, the priest's robes
- Prussian blue: ONLY the spy's coat and the sliver of night sky — the sole cool tones in a warm painting
The overall impression is of a painting bathed in amber candlelight — warm, intimate, glowing.

TEXT — ORNATE GOLD-LEAF CLASSICAL TYPOGRAPHY:

Title (positioned at 5-22% from top, centered — appearing to float in the dark upper shadow of the tavern ceiling):
"The Last Supper at" — in a medium-weight classical serif font (think Caslon, Baskerville, or Garamond) in warm antique gold (#C8A24D). The letters have a subtle gold-leaf texture — slightly uneven metallic sheen, as though real gold leaf was applied to the canvas. Medium size, elegant.
"The Leaky Barrel" — on the next line, MUCH larger, in a heavier weight of the same serif font, same gold-leaf treatment. The words "Leaky Barrel" are the visual weight of the title. The gold-leaf texture on these larger letters is more prominent — visible cracking and wear in the gold, as though the title was gilded onto the painting's surface centuries ago and has aged with it.

Subtitle (positioned at 24% from top, centered): "A Tale of the Merchant Wars" — in smaller italic serif, same warm gold color but without the gold-leaf texture — just flat warm gold, slightly transparent, floating in the dark upper portion of the image.

Author name (positioned at 90-93% from top, centered — appearing in the dark lower shadow beneath the table): "CORNELIUS VAN DER BERG" — in classical serif capitals, warm antique gold (#C8A24D) with the same gold-leaf texture as the title. Generous letter-spacing (0.2em). Below the name, a small ornamental printer's mark — a tiny woodcut-style illustration of a barrel with a crown, rendered in the same gold.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Intimate, conspiratorial, richly human — the feeling of being a fly on the wall in a candlelit tavern where every person at the table has a secret and the stakes are someone's fortune, someone's freedom, or someone's life. The painting is warm, textural, alive with the imperfect beauty of oil paint on canvas. The eight characters create a complex web of glances, gestures, and hidden actions that reward extended viewing — every time you look at the painting, you notice something new (the pickpocket's hand, the letter being passed, the spy's glinting eye).

At thumbnail, the single candle flame blazing in the center of deep darkness creates an immediately arresting image — the warm amber glow against the surrounding black is one of art history's most powerful visual effects. At full resolution, the impasto brushwork, the canvas texture, the eight individually characterized faces, and the still-life details of the table are extraordinary.

THIS IS OIL PAINTING. Thick, textural, layered, handmade. Visible brushstrokes EVERYWHERE. Visible canvas. Visible varnish. The beauty is in the paint itself — the physicality of pigment on surface, the warm luminosity of layered glazes, the confident marks of a master painter's brush.
