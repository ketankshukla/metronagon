---

A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic book cover rendered at 1024x1536 pixels in sharp cinematic digital style with dramatic noir lighting, harsh shadow contrasts, and cold atmospheric tension. This must look like the poster for a Fincher-directed crime thriller — every surface gritty, every shadow deliberate, every detail contributing to unease. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly brushstrokes, NO soft-focus artistic filters. Every pixel must be razor-sharp, hyper-detailed, and cinematically lit.

SUBJECT — A DETECTIVE IN THE RAIN AT A CRIME SCENE:

A woman of Northern European descent in her late 30s, positioned in the lower-left of the image, shown from the shoulders up in a three-quarter view facing right. She is standing outside at night in heavy rain, her face lit by the harsh blue-white flashing lights of police vehicles just out of frame to her right. She wears a dark navy trench coat with the collar turned up against the rain, the fabric darkened with water, each raindrop visible on the material. Her detective badge hangs from a chain around her neck — dull gold metal catching the police lights. She holds a cigarette between the first two fingers of her right hand, the ember a single point of warm orange-amber in the overwhelmingly cold blue scene. A thin curl of smoke rises from the cigarette, backlit by the police flashers.

FACE — WEATHERED, INTELLIGENT, HAUNTED:

Her face tells a story of sleepless nights and relentless focus. She is not conventionally glamorous — she is striking in the way that intelligence and determination make a face compelling. Her skin is fair with a cool undertone, slightly weather-roughened — visible pores, faint lines at the corners of her eyes from years of squinting at evidence, dark circles under her eyes that she has stopped trying to conceal. Her eyes are the focal point — pale grey-blue, almost colorless in certain light, with an intensity that feels like being X-rayed. They are fixed on something to the right, off-camera — the crime scene — and her expression is one of cold analytical focus layered over something deeply personal. Her brows are strong and slightly furrowed. A small scar sits at the corner of her lower lip — barely visible, but there. Her hair is dirty blonde going slightly grey at the temples, pulled back in a hasty, practical ponytail that has come loose in the rain — wet strands plastered against her neck and temples. No makeup, no pretense — this is a woman who forgot to eat dinner and will forget to sleep tonight.

BACKGROUND — RAIN-SOAKED URBAN CRIME SCENE AT NIGHT:

The background is an urban alleyway at night, deliberately out of focus (cinematic depth-of-field) but loaded with atmospheric detail. Wet asphalt reflects the flashing police lights in shattered blue-and-red streaks. Yellow crime scene tape stretches across the mid-ground, the plastic tape catching rain and light, the words "CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS" partially legible. A dark figure (forensics technician in white coveralls) kneels in the background, blurred, illuminated by a portable flood light that casts harsh white shadows. The alley walls are grimy brick — old, industrial, stained with decades of urban grime. A single streetlamp at the far end of the alley creates a halo of sickly yellow-orange light in the rain, the only warm tone in the entire background. Dumpsters and scattered urban debris line the edges. Everything is wet — every surface reflecting, shimmering, dripping.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Rain is the dominant atmospheric element — heavy, relentless, rendered with individual droplets visible in the foreground, becoming a shimmering curtain in the mid-ground. The police flasher lights create rhythmic blue-white pulses that strobe across every wet surface. The overall color palette is brutally cold — steel blue, desaturated navy, charcoal grey, with the only warmth being the cigarette ember and the distant streetlamp. Breath vapor is faintly visible from her mouth in the cold night air. The mood is tension, dread, and the grinding weight of a case that is about to become personal.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

The woman's face occupies roughly the 52%-70% vertical zone. The top 40% contains only the rainy night sky, upper portions of alley walls, rain, and atmospheric effects. No part of her face or body enters the top 35%.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:

Line 1 (exactly 3% from top): "A DETECTIVE MAREN COLE THRILLER" — small sans-serif font (Bebas Neue style), centered, steel blue color (#6B8BA4), letter-spacing 0.2em, approximately 14pt.

Line 2 (exactly 6% from top): thin horizontal line in steel blue, centered, width 40% of image.

Lines 3-4 (title block, exactly 10-22% from top): "THE LAST WITNESS" — large, bold condensed sans-serif font, centered, stark white with a faint cold blue glow and hard shadow beneath. "THE LAST" on one line, "WITNESS" on the next, significantly larger. The letters are sharp and uncompromising — no flourishes, no warmth.

Line 5 (exactly 26% from top): "She saw everything. Now someone wants her to forget." — smaller italic sans-serif, centered, pale grey/blue color.

Line 6 (exactly 92% from top): "SARAH LINDQVIST" — large condensed sans-serif font, centered, white with letter-spacing 0.15em. Clean, cold, authoritative.

OVERALL MOOD:

Cold, tense, oppressive — the weight of a rainy night, a fresh crime scene, and a detective who knows this one is different. The cover should make a thriller reader feel uneasy and compelled simultaneously. At thumbnail size, the stark contrast of the white title against the dark, rain-soaked scene creates instant impact.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting texture. NO watercolor. NO canvas grain. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART — gritty, sharp, and unrelenting.
