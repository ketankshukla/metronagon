---

A luminous book cover rendered as a Byzantine mosaic — the ancient art of assembling tiny colored glass and stone tiles (tesserae) into figurative images on gold backgrounds. The cover depicts a cartographer holding an unrolled map of Constantinople, rendered in the rigid, frontal, hieratic style of Byzantine mosaic art where figures face the viewer directly, backgrounds are solid gold, and every surface glitters with the fractured light of thousands of individual tesserae. Each tiny tile is individually visible, creating the characteristic shimmering, slightly rough surface of real mosaic.

THE GOLD BACKGROUND:

The background is composed of gold tesserae — tiny square tiles of gold-leaf glass, each approximately 1cm square (rendered at about 0.5% of image width). The gold tiles are NOT uniform — each tessera is set at a SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANGLE, the defining characteristic of Byzantine gold mosaic: each tile catches light differently, creating a shimmering, living surface of fractured golden light rather than a flat gold plane. The gold varies from bright (#FFE880) where tiles catch direct light to deep warm (#A08020) where tiles angle away. The slight gaps between tesserae (the grout lines) are visible as a fine dark grid (#3A2810) — the mortar bed into which the tiles are pressed.

THE CARTOGRAPHER (center, 20-75% from top):

A single figure — a scholar in Byzantine court dress — stands frontally, facing the viewer directly (the standard Byzantine convention). He holds an unrolled scroll-map before him.

FACE: Rendered in the mosaic tradition — a frontal, symmetrical face composed of flesh-toned tesserae in warm pinks (#D0A090), pale creams (#F0E0D0), and shadow tones of olive (#8A7A60). The features are defined by the placement of darker tesserae: dark brown tiles for the eyes (large, almond-shaped, with prominent dark outlines), small red-brown tiles for the lips, olive tiles for the nose shadow. The face has the characteristic Byzantine expression: solemn, knowing, eternal. A dark beard is composed of tiny dark brown and black tesserae.

HALO: Behind the figure's head, a circular halo — NOT the golden nimbus of a saint but a blue (#1A3A8B) circle composed of deep blue glass tesserae, suggesting intellectual rather than spiritual illumination. The blue halo distinguishes this secular scholar from the saints that typically populate Byzantine mosaics.

CLOTHING: Byzantine court dress rendered in jewel-toned tesserae:
- An outer robe (chlamys) in deep purple (#3A1A4A) glass tesserae — the imperial Byzantine purple, here indicating a court official. The purple tiles have the characteristic deep, rich color of Byzantine glass.
- Gold embroidered borders rendered in gold tesserae — geometric patterns (Greek key, interlocking circles) composed of tiny gold tiles set against the purple.
- Beneath, a white tunic (chiton) rendered in pale tesserae (#E8E0D8) with subtle blue-grey shadows.
- Red shoes (the privilege of Byzantine court officials) in vivid vermillion tesserae (#CC2020).

THE MAP: The figure holds an unrolled scroll showing a bird's-eye view of Constantinople — the city's distinctive triangular peninsula, the Golden Horn, the Bosphorus, and the massive Theodosian Walls. The map is rendered IN MOSAIC — tiny colored tesserae depicting the city's features: blue tiles for water, cream tiles for the city, red tiles for key buildings (Hagia Sophia, the Hippodrome), dark tiles for walls. The map-within-mosaic is a masterpiece of miniaturization.

ARCHITECTURAL FRAME:

The figure stands beneath a mosaic architectural frame — a stylized arch supported by two columns, the characteristic framing device of Byzantine mosaic panels:
- COLUMNS: Two columns flanking the figure, rendered in green porphyry-colored tesserae (#2A4A30) with gold capitals in the Byzantine basket-capital style
- ARCH: A semicircular arch above, composed of alternating bands of red (#8B2020) and cream tesserae
- WITHIN THE ARCH: The city of Constantinople rendered as a mosaic skyline — tiny building shapes in warm stone-colored tesserae, with the dome of Hagia Sophia prominent at center, rendered as a small semicircle of gold tesserae

MOSAIC TECHNIQUE:

- INDIVIDUAL TESSERAE: Every single tile in the image must be individually visible — small, roughly square shapes (not perfectly regular — handcut tesserae are slightly irregular) with visible grout lines between them
- ANDAMENTO: The tesserae follow the characteristic "andamento" (flow pattern) of Byzantine mosaic — tiles arranged in curved lines that follow the contours of the form they depict. Around the face, the tiles curve in concentric arcs. In the background, they are set in regular horizontal rows. Along outlines, they follow the edge.
- MATERIAL VARIETY: Different areas use different tile materials: gold-leaf glass for backgrounds, opaque colored glass (smalti) for clothing and architectural elements, natural stone tesserae for flesh tones. Each material has slightly different reflective properties.
- GROUT: The mortar between tiles is consistently visible — a warm dark brown (#3A2810) grid that unifies the entire surface

TEXT — MOSAIC LETTERING:

Title (positioned at 5-16% from top, within the gold background above the arch):
"THE CARTOGRAPHER" — rendered as MOSAIC LETTERING — each letter composed of small dark blue (#1A3A8B) tesserae against the gold background, in the style of Byzantine mosaic inscriptions. The letterforms are slightly angular and geometric, constrained by the square shape of the tesserae — the characteristic look of text built from tiles rather than drawn with a pen.
"of CONSTANTINOPLE" — on the next line, same mosaic letter technique, in deep vermillion (#CC2020) tesserae.

Subtitle (positioned at 18% from top): "A Byzantine Novel" — in smaller mosaic letters in purple (#3A1A4A) tesserae.

Author name (positioned at 80-84% from top, below the figure's feet): "THEODORA ASHWORTH-OKAFOR" — in mosaic letters in gold tesserae against a band of dark blue.

OVERALL MOOD:

Ancient, luminous, imperially grand — the feeling of standing in the Hagia Sophia and looking up at a wall of golden tesserae that has been glittering for 1,500 years. Byzantine mosaic is one of humanity's most enduring art forms — it literally does not fade — and its hieratic, frontal, gold-saturated aesthetic communicates permanence, authority, and the grandeur of a civilization that bridged the ancient and medieval worlds.

THIS IS BYZANTINE MOSAIC ART. Individual tesserae, gold-leaf glass, jewel-toned smalti, visible grout. The beauty is in the fragments — thousands of tiny colored tiles that, assembled with ancient skill, create an image that shimmers and breathes with fractured light.
