---

A luxurious, tactile book cover that looks like a piece of antique French silk brocade — the entire image rendered as a textile surface with a complex figurative scene WOVEN into the fabric pattern using the jacquard technique. The cover does not depict silk — it IS silk, rendered with such material precision that the viewer can almost feel the smooth, slightly cool surface of woven silk and the raised texture of the brocade pattern. The figurative scene (a woman at a loom, a city burning in the background) is integrated into the fabric's decorative pattern, as though this piece of silk IS the story.

THE SILK SURFACE:

The background is a field of deep sapphire blue silk (#0A1A4A) — the rich, saturated blue of French silk dyed with indigo. The silk surface has the characteristic visual properties of real woven fabric:
- WARP AND WEFT: At high resolution, the individual threads of the weave are faintly visible — a fine, regular grid of horizontal (weft) and vertical (warp) threads creating the characteristic micro-texture of silk fabric
- SHEEN: Silk has a distinctive luster — a soft, directional sheen that creates lighter and darker areas depending on the fabric's angle relative to the light. The sapphire blue shifts from bright (#1A3A6A) where the light catches the surface to deep (#050A2A) in areas where the sheen angles away
- DRAPE FOLDS: Two or three subtle fabric folds cross the image — gentle, flowing creases that demonstrate the fabric's weight and drape. The folds create highlight ridges and shadow valleys in the blue silk

THE BROCADE PATTERN — THE WOVEN SCENE:

Integrated into the silk surface, a complex figurative scene rendered in gold metallic thread (#D4AF37) and cream silk (#FFF0D0) — the raised brocade pattern that tells the story:

THE WEAVER (center, 30-65% from top): A woman sits at a large Jacquard loom — the figure woven in gold thread against the blue silk ground. She is rendered in the stylized, somewhat flattened manner characteristic of textile design — not photorealistic but beautifully detailed within the constraints of woven imagery. Her posture is focused, her hands on the loom's mechanisms, her profile elegant. She wears period-appropriate 18th-century dress — rendered as intricate gold thread patterns on blue silk. Her hair is pinned up in the style of the 1790s.

THE LOOM: The Jacquard loom itself is woven in fine gold thread detail — the characteristic tall frame, the punch-card mechanism at the top (historically significant — the Jacquard loom's punch cards were the ancestor of computer programming), and the partially completed fabric on the loom showing a different, smaller pattern being woven within the larger brocade. This meta-detail — a weaver weaving within a woven image — is the cover's conceptual heart.

THE CITY (background, 20-40% from top): Behind the weaver, the skyline of Lyon, France — woven in gold thread: the distinctive silhouettes of the Basilica of Fourvière, the bridges over the Saône and Rhône rivers, the clustered rooftops of the Croix-Rousse district (the silk weavers' quarter). But the city is ON FIRE — flames rendered as gold and crimson (#8B1A1A) thread patterns rising from the rooftops, smoke as dark grey (#3A3A4A) thread areas. The Revolution has come to Lyon.

DECORATIVE BORDER: Surrounding the figurative scene, an ornamental brocade border of stylized floral motifs — the classic French silk design vocabulary: acanthus scrolls, rosettes, and laurel garlands woven in gold thread with cream silk highlights. The border is approximately 5% wide on each side.

TEXTILE TECHNIQUE:

The brocade pattern must look WOVEN, not painted or printed:
- RAISED TEXTURE: The gold thread areas appear to sit slightly above the blue silk ground — the characteristic three-dimensional quality of brocade where the pattern threads float over the ground weave
- THREAD DIRECTION: Within the gold pattern areas, the individual metallic threads are visible, running in the same direction, creating the slightly striated surface of real metal-thread weaving
- METALLIC QUALITY: The gold thread is not flat yellow but has the characteristic shimmer and color variation of real metallic thread — slightly different tones where threads cross, brighter where light catches the metal surface
- PATTERN LIMITATIONS: The image respects the visual limitations of woven textile — shapes are slightly geometric, curves are built from stepped thread increments, and the finest details are constrained by thread count. This creates a characteristic textile aesthetic that is beautiful but different from painted imagery
- WEAR: Slight areas where the gold thread has worn thin from handling — the raised brocade pattern is the most vulnerable part of antique silk and shows wear first. A few areas where individual gold threads have broken and curled slightly

COLOR PALETTE — FRENCH SILK:

- Sapphire blue silk: #0A1A4A (with sheen variations #1A3A6A to #050A2A)
- Gold metallic thread: #D4AF37 (with variations #FFE880 bright to #A08020 shadow)
- Cream silk highlights: #FFF0D0
- Fire crimson thread: #8B1A1A
- Smoke grey thread: #3A3A4A

TEXT — WOVEN INTO THE FABRIC:

Title (positioned at 5-18% from top, within the upper decorative border):
"THE SILK WEAVER" — the text appears to be WOVEN into the fabric as part of the brocade pattern — gold thread letterforms integrated into the decorative border. The font is an elegant, period-appropriate serif with slightly geometric qualities that respect the woven medium. The letters are formed from gold thread against the blue ground, with the same raised texture as the rest of the brocade.
"of LYON" — below, same woven-gold treatment, slightly smaller.

Subtitle (positioned at 20% from top): "A Novel of the French Revolution" — woven in cream silk thread, smaller, within the border pattern.

Author name (positioned at 88-92% from top, in the lower decorative border): "MARIE-CLAIRE BEAUMONT-OKAFOR" — woven in gold thread.

OVERALL MOOD:

Sumptuous, historical, tragically beautiful — the feeling of holding a piece of silk that survived the burning of Lyon, a textile that carries the story of the woman who wove it and the revolution that destroyed her world. The textile-as-cover approach is unique — the cover IS the art form at the story's center, and the figurative scene woven into it is simultaneously decorative art and narrative illustration.

THIS IS WOVEN SILK BROCADE. Gold metallic thread on sapphire silk, raised texture, textile sheen. The beauty is in the material — the cover looks and feels like fabric, and the story is literally woven into its surface.
