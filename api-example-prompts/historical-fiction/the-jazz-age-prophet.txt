TYPE: Paperback Front Cover
DIMENSIONS: 1024 x 1536 pixels, sRGB color profile
GENRE: Historical Fiction / Harlem Renaissance
ART STYLE: Art Deco meets African American modernist art — the geometric precision and metallic glamour of 1920s Art Deco design fused with the bold graphic style of Harlem Renaissance visual art. Inspired by the poster art and illustration style of the era's African American artists who merged Deco geometry with African design motifs and the electric energy of jazz. Bold geometric figures, metallic gold and bronze, deep jewel tones, and the kinetic rhythm of jazz made visual.

---

A vibrant, rhythmic book cover that fuses two visual traditions of the 1920s: the geometric luxury of Art Deco and the bold, culturally proud graphic style of Harlem Renaissance visual art. The cover pulses with the energy of jazz — geometric shapes arranged with musical rhythm, metallic surfaces catching light like saxophone keys, and a central figure rendered as a monumental, stylized form that is simultaneously Art Deco design object and cultural icon. The style is flat, graphic, and poster-bold, with the decorative density and metallic shimmer of the Jazz Age.

THE CENTRAL FIGURE — THE PROPHET (center, 20-80% from top):

A stylized figure — a man at a podium or microphone — rendered as a geometric, Art Deco form:

The figure is NOT naturalistically rendered — he is composed of geometric shapes in the Deco manner: his body is a series of angular planes, his shoulders are broad geometric triangles, his head is a strong oval with features reduced to essential, powerful graphic elements. His skin is rendered in rich bronze (#8B6B40) — not a flat color but a metallic bronze with the characteristic Deco treatment of metal surfaces: geometric highlight planes in bright gold-bronze (#D0A050) and shadow planes in deep warm brown (#4A3020).

FACE: Stylized but powerful — geometric features that convey authority and vision. Strong jaw, prominent brow, eyes that look upward and outward (toward the future). The features draw on the Deco tradition of geometric idealization AND the African American modernist tradition of dignified, powerful representation.

CLOTHING: A sharp 1920s suit rendered in Deco geometric style — the suit is deep midnight blue (#0A1A3A) with geometric gold (#D4AF37) pinstripes that echo African textile patterns (kente-inspired geometric repeats rather than simple parallel lines). A gold watch chain. A white shirt with a high collar. The clothing is rendered as flat geometric planes with metallic accents.

GESTURE: One hand raised, palm outward — the gesture of a preacher, a prophet, an orator. The hand is large and powerful, rendered as bold geometric planes. The other hand grips the edge of a podium (or perhaps holds a saxophone — the image is deliberately ambiguous between prophet and musician, because in the Harlem Renaissance, they were the same).

BEHIND THE FIGURE — JAZZ GEOMETRY:

Radiating outward from the figure, a dynamic geometric composition representing the energy of jazz and the Harlem Renaissance:

SUNBURST/SOUND WAVES: Geometric rays spread outward from behind the figure's head — a stylized sunburst pattern that is simultaneously a Deco design motif, a halo of cultural enlightenment, and the visual representation of sound waves radiating from a performer. The rays alternate between gold (#D4AF37) and deep purple (#2A0A3A), creating a bold, rhythmic pattern.

MUSICAL ELEMENTS: Woven into the geometric background, stylized musical forms — saxophone keys rendered as gold geometric shapes, piano keys as a bold black-and-white zigzag pattern, musical notes as geometric symbols. These elements are integrated into the overall geometric composition rather than floating separately.

CITYSCAPE: At the lower edges, a stylized Harlem cityscape — the geometric silhouettes of brownstones, the Apollo Theater marquee (suggested by a bright rectangular light shape), and the elevated train tracks rendered as bold horizontal lines. The city is rendered in deep tones (#1A1A2A) with bright, warm window-lights in amber (#FFD080) and the neon glow of signs in hot pink (#FF3070) and electric blue (#3070FF).

AFRICAN-INSPIRED GEOMETRIC PATTERNS:

Framing the composition, geometric border patterns that blend Art Deco motifs with African design traditions:
- Zigzag patterns reminiscent of both Deco stepped pyramids and West African textile designs
- Concentric circle motifs that echo both Deco target patterns and Adinkra symbols
- Interlocking triangles in gold and bronze that reference both Deco geometry and African beadwork

These border patterns run along the left and right edges, integrating the two cultural traditions into a unified visual language.

TEXT — DECO DISPLAY:

Title (positioned at 5-18% from top, centered within the sunburst area):
"THE JAZZ AGE" — in a bold Art Deco display font (think Broadway, Poiret One, or a Jazz Age-appropriate display face) in bright gold (#D4AF37) with the metallic shimmer treatment. Large, geometric, glamorous.
"PROPHET" — on the next line, same Deco font, LARGER, in hot pink (#FF3070). The gold-to-pink shift captures the Jazz Age's combination of luxury and rebellion.

Subtitle (positioned at 20% from top): "A Harlem Renaissance Novel" — in small Deco sans-serif in cream (#FFF0D0), letter-spacing 0.25em.

Author name (positioned at 85-88% from top, within the cityscape area): "LANGSTON VALE-OKAFOR" — in Deco display font in gold (#D4AF37), letter-spacing 0.15em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Electric, proud, culturally monumental — the feeling of standing on Lenox Avenue in 1926 and hearing, from an open window, a saxophone playing something that has never been played before, while in the apartment above, a poet is writing something that has never been written before. The fusion of Art Deco luxury and Harlem Renaissance cultural pride creates a visual language of sophisticated rebellion — beauty as a political act.

THIS IS ART DECO MEETS HARLEM RENAISSANCE. Geometric stylization, metallic surfaces, jazz rhythm made visual. The beauty is in the fusion — two visual traditions of the 1920s merging into something more powerful than either alone.
