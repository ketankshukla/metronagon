---

A book cover built around a single stunning landscape photograph that occupies the ENTIRE image — edge to edge, top to bottom, no borders, no frames. The photograph is rendered with the quality of a National Geographic cover or a fine art landscape print by photographers like Gregory Crewdson, Todd Hido, or Michael Kenna. The entire mood comes from the landscape itself — there are NO people anywhere in this image. Not a single human figure, not a silhouette, not a hint of a person. The absence of people IS the point — this cover is about a place, and the quiet, heavy feeling that the place itself is holding its breath.

THE PHOTOGRAPH — A LONE CABIN ON A MISTY LAKE AT DAWN:

The camera is positioned at the edge of a still, glass-flat lake, shooting across the water toward the far shore. The camera is low — barely above the water's surface — so the bottom 15% of the image is the lake's surface stretching toward the viewer, creating an immersive, wading-in feeling.

THE LAKE: The water is perfectly still — mirror-flat, not a single ripple, not a breath of wind. The surface is so calm that it reflects the entire scene above it in a near-perfect mirror image, slightly darker and more muted than reality (as real water reflections are). The water color is a deep, muted grey-green — the color of deep freshwater in the Pacific Northwest or Scandinavia, tinged with tannins from forest runoff. In the extreme foreground (bottom 5% of image), the shallow water near the camera position is clearer, and through it, smooth river stones are visible on the lake bed — grey, brown, and moss-green stones, softened by the water above them, slightly out of focus due to the shallow depth-of-field. A single fallen leaf — deep burnt orange, the only warm color in the entire image — floats on the water surface in the lower-left, perfectly still, its reflection creating a tiny symmetrical splash of color.

THE FAR SHORE (MIDDLE GROUND): Approximately 200 meters across the lake, the far shore is a dense wall of old-growth evergreen forest — massive Douglas firs and Western red cedars rising straight and tall, their trunks dark charcoal-brown, their canopy a solid mass of deep forest green so dark it is nearly black. The treeline is reflected in the lake, creating a dark green band across the center of the image. The trees are rendered with photographic precision — individual branch structures visible on the nearest trees, the canopy becoming a unified mass further back. Where the trees meet the water, a narrow strip of rocky beach is visible — pale grey gravel and scattered driftwood logs, bleached silver-white by years of weather.

THE CABIN: Nestled among the trees at the far shore, slightly left of center, sits a small wooden cabin. It is the ONLY man-made structure in the entire image, and it is small — perhaps 8% of the image width, 5% of the image height. The cabin is simple, weathered, and solitary: a rectangular structure of dark-stained cedar planks, a peaked roof with cedar shake shingles covered in thick green moss, a single small window facing the lake, and a narrow wooden dock extending ten feet into the water from the cabin's shore. The dock is old — some planks are missing, others are warped and grey with age. A single wooden rowboat is tied to the dock — dark green paint, most of it peeled away to reveal grey wood beneath. The boat sits low in the water, half-filled with rainwater.

The cabin's single window is dark. No light, no warmth, no sign of occupancy. But the door — barely visible at this distance — appears to be open. Just slightly. Just enough to notice.

THE SKY AND ATMOSPHERE:

The sky occupies the top 40% of the image and is the primary source of the cover's mood. It is the sky of very early dawn — the sun has not yet risen, but the eastern horizon (right side of the image) is beginning to lighten. The sky transitions from deep slate grey at the top to a pale, washed-out silver-white at the horizon, with a single band of muted dusty rose — barely pink, more like the memory of pink — along the horizon line where the dawn light is just beginning to warm the clouds. The clouds are high, thin stratus layers — not dramatic cumulus thunderheads, but flat, horizontal sheets of grey that create subtle horizontal banding across the sky, like geological strata. The cloud layers trap the dawn light and diffuse it, creating a soft, even illumination with almost no shadows — the hallmark of overcast dawn light. The reflection of this sky in the lake below creates a beautiful symmetry — the image is nearly mirrored at the horizontal midpoint.

MIST: The critical atmospheric element. A low-lying mist hangs over the lake, hugging the water surface, extending from the far shore outward toward the camera. The mist is not opaque — it is translucent, like gauze, allowing the cabin and treeline to be visible through it but softened, slightly obscured, as though seen through a veil. The mist is thickest at the far shore (where it pools among the tree trunks and partially obscures the base of the cabin) and thins as it extends toward the camera. Tendrils of mist curl and drift above the water surface — each one faintly visible, caught in the dawn light, moving so slowly they appear frozen. The mist gives the entire scene a dreamlike, suspended quality — time has stopped, the world is holding its breath.

COLOR PALETTE — MUTED, NATURAL, DESATURATED:

This is NOT a colorful image. The palette is deliberately muted and restrained — the colors of the natural world before sunrise, when everything is drained of saturation and exists in a narrow tonal range:
- Deep forest green (nearly black): #1A2E1A — the dominant tree color
- Slate grey: #5A6B7A — sky, water, stones
- Moss green: #4A5E3A — cabin roof, water tint
- Dusty rose: #C4A0A0 — the faintest hint at the horizon, barely there
- Silver-white: #D4D8DC — mist, sky highlights, bleached driftwood
- Warm brown: #5A4030 — cabin wood, tree trunks
- Burnt orange: #B85C2A — ONLY the single fallen leaf, the cover's sole warm accent
The overall tonal impression is cool, grey-green, and hushed. Every color whispers.

TEXT — ELEGANT, THIN, UNDERSTATED. THE TYPOGRAPHY WHISPERS TOO:

Title (positioned at 12-26% from top, centered over the sky area):
"still" — rendered in lowercase, thin-weight serif font (think Cormorant Garamond Light or Freight Text Light) in a muted sage green (#6B7F62). The word is rendered at medium size, elegant and quiet, with generous letter-spacing (0.3em). Lowercase is deliberate — it feels intimate, literary, unhurried.
"water" — rendered on the next line, same font, same color, same size, same letter-spacing. The two words are stacked with generous line spacing (leading) — there is breathing room between them, visual silence.

The text has NO glow, NO shadow, NO outline, NO effects. It simply sits on the image, the sage green color chosen specifically to harmonize with the forest tones behind it while remaining legible against the lighter sky. The text feels like it belongs to the landscape — as natural as the trees and the mist.

Subtitle (positioned at 28% from top, centered): "a novel" — in the same font, same color, even smaller, all lowercase, letter-spacing 0.4em. A whisper of a subtitle.

Author name (positioned at 90-93% from top, centered over the dark water/reflection area): "INGRID SOLHEIM" — in small, thin-weight sans-serif font (think Gill Sans Light or Avenir Light) in a muted silver-white (#B8BCC0) that is just barely lighter than the dark water beneath it. All uppercase, generous letter-spacing (0.3em). The author name is understated to the point of near-invisibility — it rewards attention rather than demanding it. No line, no ornament, no flourish.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Quiet. Still. Heavy with unspoken things. The cover evokes the feeling of arriving at a lake house very early in the morning, before anyone else is awake, and standing at the water's edge in the silence and the mist, and realizing that the silence is not empty — it is full of something you cannot name. The beauty is in the restraint — no drama, no spectacle, no color, no people. Just a lake, a cabin, a mist, a door that might be open, and a silence so deep it becomes a sound.

This cover targets literary fiction readers who are drawn to quiet, atmospheric storytelling — readers of Marilynne Robinson, Kent Haruf, Elizabeth Strout. At thumbnail size, the horizontal symmetry of sky/water and the centered cabin silhouette create an instantly recognizable literary fiction aesthetic. At full resolution, the photographic detail — the stones beneath the clear water, the moss on the roof, the individual mist tendrils — is museum-print quality.

THIS IS FINE ART PHOTOGRAPHY. Photorealistic, natural light, no manipulation beyond tasteful color grading. No fantasy elements, no magic, no monsters. The real world, rendered with such beauty and attention that it becomes uncanny. The horror, if there is any, is in the open door and the empty boat and the perfect, terrible stillness.
