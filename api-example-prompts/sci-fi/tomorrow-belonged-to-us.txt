TOMORROW BELONGED TO US — AN ATOMIC AGE NOVEL
TYPE: Paperback Front Cover
DIMENSIONS: 1024 x 1536 pixels, sRGB color profile
GENRE: Retro-Futurism / Alternate History Science Fiction
ART STYLE: 1950s atomic age retro-futurism poster art — clean geometric shapes, limited flat color palette, mid-century modern design sensibility with bold graphic simplicity. Think vintage NASA promotional posters, Saul Bass title sequences, and Googie architecture rendered as flat graphic design. No photorealism — this is graphic poster art with the optimism and clean geometry of the space age.

---

A bold, graphic book cover rendered in the clean, optimistic visual language of 1950s atomic age poster art and mid-century modern graphic design. The style is FLAT, GEOMETRIC, and GRAPHIC — no photorealism, no texture, no gradients (except very simple two-tone gradients). Every element is reduced to its simplest geometric form. The color palette is strictly limited to 5-6 flat colors. The overall feel is a vintage NASA recruitment poster or a Saul Bass movie title card — confident, clean, and radiating mid-century optimism about the future.

THE COMPOSITION — A SINGLE ICONIC GRAPHIC IMAGE:

The cover is built from simple geometric shapes arranged into a single, immediately readable image: a stylized rocket ship launching from a stylized Earth, framed by a perfect circle suggesting a planet or porthole.

THE CENTRAL CIRCLE (occupying 40-85% of the image vertically, centered):

A large perfect circle dominates the center of the cover. The circle is filled with a simple two-tone gradient: deep navy blue (#1B2A4A) at the top transitioning to a warm teal (#008080) at the bottom — suggesting the transition from deep space to atmosphere. This circle represents both a planet and a viewport — the frame through which we see the future.

THE ROCKET (inside the circle, launching upward):

A stylized rocket ship, rendered in the Googie/atomic age aesthetic — NOT a realistic Saturn V, but the idealized, art-deco-influenced rocket of 1950s imagination: a sleek, elongated teardrop shape with swept-back fins at the base, a needle-pointed nose cone, and a single circular porthole window on its body. The rocket is rendered as a FLAT shape — solid white (#FFFFFF) body with a bright vermillion red (#CC3333) nose cone and fin tips. No shading, no texture — just clean, flat geometric shapes. A single yellow (#FFD700) circle represents the porthole. The rocket is angled slightly — not perfectly vertical but tilted 10 degrees to the right, adding dynamic energy.

The rocket's exhaust is the most graphic element: a symmetrical, stylized thrust plume rendered as three nested chevron shapes pointing downward — the innermost chevron in bright white, the middle in warm yellow (#FFD700), the outermost in vermillion red (#CC3333). The exhaust chevrons extend below the rocket and break out of the bottom of the central circle, overlapping its edge — the rocket is too powerful to be contained by the frame. Below the exhaust, inside the lower portion of the circle, a curved horizon line suggests Earth's surface — a simple arc of warm teal with a thin white atmospheric glow line above it.

STAR FIELD (inside the circle, behind the rocket):

The navy blue upper portion of the circle contains a sparse arrangement of stars — NOT realistic pinpoints but stylized mid-century star shapes: simple four-pointed stars in white and pale yellow, varying in size, evenly but not symmetrically distributed. Each star is a clean geometric shape — two intersecting diamonds. Three concentric orbit lines (thin white ellipses) arc across the star field behind the rocket, suggesting orbital paths. A small stylized crescent moon in pale yellow sits in the upper-left quadrant of the circle.

THE BACKGROUND (outside the circle):

The background surrounding the central circle is a flat, solid field of warm cream (#FFF5E0) — the slightly yellowed white of mid-century print stock. This warm cream is the cover's "paper color" and occupies all space not filled by the circle or text. The simplicity of this background is critical — it gives the central graphic room to breathe and creates the unmistakable look of a vintage poster.

DECORATIVE GEOMETRIC FRAME:

A thin geometric border surrounds the central circle — NOT touching it but floating 3% outside it. This border is composed of simple geometric elements: thin straight lines in navy blue (#1B2A4A) forming a rounded rectangle with small atomic-symbol decorations at each corner (a simple circle with three elliptical orbit lines, the universal symbol of the atomic age). The border is minimal and precise — it frames the composition without competing with it.

COLOR PALETTE — STRICTLY LIMITED MID-CENTURY:

Only 6 colors are used in the ENTIRE image:
- Warm cream background: #FFF5E0
- Deep navy blue: #1B2A4A — circle upper half, border, text
- Warm teal: #008080 — circle lower half, Earth horizon
- Vermillion red: #CC3333 — rocket nose/fins, exhaust outer, accent text
- Bright white: #FFFFFF — rocket body, stars, exhaust inner
- Warm yellow/gold: #FFD700 — porthole, stars, exhaust middle
NO other colors. NO black (navy serves as the darkest tone). NO grey. The limited palette is the design's strength — it creates instant visual coherence and unmistakable vintage authority.

TEXT — MID-CENTURY MODERN TYPOGRAPHY, CLEAN AND GEOMETRIC:

Title (positioned at 5-18% from top, centered above the circle):
"TOMORROW" — rendered in a clean, geometric sans-serif font with uniform stroke width (think Futura, Century Gothic, or Avenir — the quintessential mid-century typefaces). All uppercase, large, in deep navy blue (#1B2A4A). The letters are widely spaced (letter-spacing 0.2em), perfectly geometric, and exude quiet confidence. Medium-large size.
"BELONGED TO US" — rendered on the next line, same font, same color, but SMALLER — approximately 60% of the "TOMORROW" size. Same letter-spacing. The size contrast creates a natural reading hierarchy: the eye hits "TOMORROW" first, then drops to the qualifier.

Between the title and the circle, a thin horizontal line in vermillion red (#CC3333), width 30% of the image, centered — a simple graphic divider that adds a pop of warm color to the cool upper composition.

Subtitle (positioned at 86-88% from top, centered below the circle): "AN ATOMIC AGE NOVEL" — in small, widely-spaced sans-serif capitals in warm teal (#008080), letter-spacing 0.3em. Clean and informational, like a museum placard.

Author name (positioned at 91-94% from top, centered): "RAYMOND CHEN-OKAFOR" — in medium sans-serif capitals in deep navy blue (#1B2A4A), letter-spacing 0.2em. Clean, authoritative, balanced. Below the author name, a tiny atomic symbol (circle with orbit lines) in vermillion red serves as a decorative colophon.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Optimistic, clean, retro-futuristic — the feeling of a 1950s world's fair poster promising a gleaming future of space travel, atomic energy, and human progress. The design is deceptively simple — the limited palette, the geometric shapes, and the clean typography create an image that feels timeless and authoritative. This cover says: "The future was supposed to be beautiful. This is the story of what happened."

At thumbnail, the white rocket against the dark circle on the cream background is instantly readable and visually striking. The vermillion accents pop. At full resolution, the geometric precision and the perfect flatness of every element create a poster-quality image that could hang on a wall.

THIS IS MID-CENTURY GRAPHIC POSTER ART. Flat, geometric, limited palette, no texture, no photorealism. The beauty is in the reduction — every element simplified to its purest geometric form, every color chosen for maximum contrast and harmony within a strict palette.
