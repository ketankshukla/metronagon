---

A glamorous, stylized book cover rendered as a vintage 1930s Shanghai movie poster — the unique graphic design tradition that emerged in pre-war Shanghai when Western Art Deco geometric design merged with Chinese aesthetic traditions to create some of the most visually striking poster art of the 20th century. The style is flat, graphic, and poster-bold: strong outlines, limited flat colors, stylized figures, and the characteristic blend of Deco geometry with Chinese decorative motifs.

THE COMPOSITION — A POSTER IN TWO ZONES:

The cover is divided into two zones: an upper zone dominated by a stylized figure, and a lower zone with Art Deco architectural elements and atmospheric Shanghai cityscape.

THE FEMME FATALE (upper portion, 15-65% from top):

A woman rendered in the flat, graphic style of 1930s Shanghai poster art — stylized but immediately recognizable:

She is shown in three-quarter view from the waist up, her body angled slightly right, her face turned to look directly at the viewer over her left shoulder. Her expression is the classic noir look: cool, appraising, with half-lidded eyes that suggest she knows more than she's saying.

FACE AND HAIR: Rendered in the poster style — simplified, idealized features with strong graphic outlines. Her face is a smooth, warm oval (#E8C8A0) with minimal modeling — flat color with just enough shadow (applied as a separate flat color area, not a gradient) to define cheekbones and jaw. Her lips are vivid red (#CC2020) — the poster's brightest warm accent. Her eyes are large, dark, and heavily lined in the 1930s Shanghai fashion — thick black eyeliner creating the dramatic eye shape seen in period photographs. Her hair is black (#0A0A0A), styled in the characteristic 1930s Shanghai wave — finger-waves sculpted close to the head, rendered as elegant curved lines that flow like Art Deco ornamental patterns.

QIPAO: She wears a form-fitting qipao (cheongsam) in deep jade green (#1A6B4A) — the cover's dominant color and the "jade" of the title. The qipao is rendered as a flat graphic shape with the characteristic Mandarin collar, frog-button closures, and fitted silhouette of the 1930s Shanghai style. The fabric is decorated with a subtle pattern: gold (#D4AF37) geometric Art Deco motifs integrated with traditional Chinese cloud patterns (yun-wen), creating the characteristic East-West fusion of the era. The pattern is rendered as flat gold shapes on the jade green — no texture, no shading, pure graphic design.

ACCESSORIES: She holds a long cigarette holder (a 1930s noir staple) in her right hand, the thin line of smoke rising in a single elegant Art Deco spiral. A jade bracelet (deeper green) on her left wrist. A string of pearls catching the light as simple white dots along a curved line.

THE SHANGHAI CITYSCAPE (lower portion, 60-90% from top):

Below the figure, a stylized Art Deco Shanghai skyline — the legendary Bund waterfront rendered as a graphic, flat poster cityscape:

- The buildings are simplified to their geometric essences: the Customs House clock tower, the Cathay Hotel (now Peace Hotel), and the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank building — each rendered as a flat, angular Art Deco shape in dark navy (#0A1A3A) against a slightly lighter night sky
- The Huangpu River appears as a horizontal band of deep blue-black (#0A0A28) with gold reflections (#D4AF37) — simple, horizontal zigzag lines representing light on water
- Neon signs (rendered as flat geometric shapes in neon colors — red, yellow, green) glow from building facades, with Chinese characters suggested as simplified graphic shapes
- A single sampan (traditional boat) on the river — a simple, dark silhouette shape

THE ATMOSPHERIC ELEMENTS:

- FOG: Horizontal bands of lighter color (#2A3A4A) between the buildings, suggesting the river fog that was characteristic of 1930s Shanghai waterfront
- SEARCHLIGHT: A single diagonal beam of pale light (#D0D0C0) sweeping across the sky from a building rooftop — a common element in period Shanghai poster art
- STARS: Simple, stylized four-pointed star shapes in gold (#D4AF37) scattered in the upper sky

ART DECO DECORATIVE FRAME:

A geometric Art Deco border frames the entire composition — approximately 3% from each edge:
- Thin gold (#D4AF37) lines forming a stepped, geometric frame pattern
- Corner elements: small Art Deco fan/sunburst motifs in gold
- The frame integrates Chinese and Deco elements: the stepped-pyramid pattern of Deco architecture combined with cloud-scroll terminals from Chinese decorative tradition

COLOR PALETTE — 1930s SHANGHAI POSTER:

Only 6 flat colors (the limited palette of screen-printed posters):
- Jade green: #1A6B4A — qipao, dominant cool tone
- Gold: #D4AF37 — pattern, border, reflections, accents
- Vivid red: #CC2020 — lips, neon signs, warm accent
- Deep navy: #0A1A3A — buildings, darkest tone
- Night sky dark: #0A0A28 — background, river
- Skin warm: #E8C8A0 — figure's skin, warm highlight
- Paper cream: #FFF0D8 — text areas, lightest tone
NO gradients, NO texture, NO photorealism. Every color is a FLAT, SOLID area — the hallmark of poster printing.

TEXT — DECO TYPOGRAPHY WITH CHINESE INFLUENCE:

Title (positioned at 5-14% from top, centered):
"THE JADE" — in a bold Art Deco display font (think Broadway, Poiret One, or a custom Deco face) in gold (#D4AF37). Large, letter-spacing 0.15em. The geometric, decorative quality of Deco typography.
"EQUATION" — on the next line, same font, same size, in vivid red (#CC2020). The gold-to-red shift mirrors the jade-and-danger duality of the story.

Below the title, a decorative divider: a horizontal line with a small Chinese-Deco hybrid ornament at its center — a geometric diamond shape containing a simplified Chinese character (the character for "mystery" or "riddle").

Subtitle (positioned at 16% from top): "A Shanghai Noir Mystery" — in small, elegant sans-serif in cream (#FFF0D8), letter-spacing 0.2em.

Author name (positioned at 91-94% from top, within the cityscape area): "MEI-LING THORNTON-OKAFOR" — in Art Deco display font in gold (#D4AF37), letter-spacing 0.15em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Glamorous, dangerous, cosmopolitan — the feeling of 1930s Shanghai at its peak: the most exciting, most dangerous, most stylish city in Asia, where East met West in jazz clubs and opium dens, where fortunes were made and people disappeared. The poster art style captures the era's visual culture — a unique fusion of Chinese and Western aesthetics that has never been replicated.

THIS IS 1930s SHANGHAI ART DECO POSTER ART. Flat colors, bold outlines, limited palette, East-West decorative fusion. The beauty is in the style — a graphic design tradition that emerged from the collision of cultures and created something uniquely glamorous.
