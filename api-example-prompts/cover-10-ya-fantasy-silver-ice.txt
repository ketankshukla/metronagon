SUBJECT — A YOUNG WOMAN SUMMONING ICE MAGIC IN A FROZEN FOREST:

A breathtakingly beautiful young woman of Scandinavian descent, seventeen years old, positioned in the lower-center of the image. She stands in a clearing within an ancient frozen forest, her body facing forward with her arms extended to her sides, palms upward, fingers spread. From her open palms, intricate crystalline ice structures are blooming outward — not rough icicles, but impossibly beautiful geometric ice formations that spiral and branch like frozen flowers, each facet catching and refracting light into prismatic rainbows. The ice structures extend upward and outward from her hands in elegant arcs, some reaching two feet in diameter, forming a natural crown of frozen light around her body. She wears layered winter garments that blend Norse-inspired design with fantasy elegance — a fitted tunic of pale silver-blue leather over a long-sleeved underlayer of white wool, both decorated with embroidered snowflake and frost-fern patterns in silver thread. Over her shoulders, a hooded cloak of deep midnight-blue velvet lined with white arctic fox fur, the hood pushed back to reveal her face. The cloak's clasp is a silver brooch shaped like two intertwined frost-wolves. A belt of braided silver leather cinches her waist, from which hangs a short ceremonial dagger in a sheath of white bone carved with runic symbols. Her boots are dark grey leather, laced to the knee, dusted with fresh snow.

FACE — YOUTHFUL PHOTOREALISTIC BEAUTY:

Her face is strikingly beautiful with the fresh, luminous quality of youth. Fair porcelain skin with a natural pink flush across her cheeks and the tip of her nose from the cold — visible pores, a scattering of very faint freckles across her nose bridge, the skin so delicately rendered it seems to glow. Her eyes are the cover's most arresting feature — large, wide-set, and an impossible shade of ice-blue that seems to contain actual frost within the iris. The iris pattern is extraordinary — pale silver-blue at the outer edge graduating to brilliant crystalline white near the pupil, with tiny fracture lines like cracks in ice radiating outward. In the magical light from her ice constructs, her eyes seem to literally glow with cold blue fire. Her lashes are long, dark — a striking contrast to her pale features — each individually rendered with tiny ice crystals clinging to the tips. Her eyebrows are naturally shaped, a shade darker than her hair. Her nose is small and slightly upturned. Her lips are naturally pink, slightly parted in an expression of wonder and concentration — she is discovering the full extent of her power for the first time. Her hair is extraordinary — long, reaching her mid-back, the color of white-gold platinum, impossibly fine and luminous. It flows freely around her shoulders and behind her, stirred by the magical energy radiating from her hands. Frost crystals have formed on individual strands, turning her hair into a cascade of glittering ice-threaded silk. The cold light from her magic creates a halo effect around her head where it backlights the finest strands.

BACKGROUND — AN ANCIENT FROZEN FOREST UNDER THE NORTHERN LIGHTS:

Behind her, an ancient boreal forest stretches into misty depth — massive pine and spruce trees, their branches laden with thick snow, their trunks dark against the white landscape. Every branch, every needle cluster holds a precise accumulation of snow and ice, rendered with photorealistic detail. The forest floor is deep snow, unmarked except for her footprints leading to where she stands. The trees thin toward the background, revealing a dramatic sky — and above the treeline, the Aurora Borealis is in full display. The northern lights ripple across the sky in breathtaking curtains of pale green, electric teal, soft violet, and hints of pale pink — the lights are rendered with astronomical accuracy, showing the characteristic curtain-fold structure and the way they seem to pulse and shift. The aurora casts a diffuse, ethereal colored glow across the entire snow-covered landscape, tinting the white snow with soft green and violet reflections. Stars are visible through the thinner portions of the aurora — a dense field of pinpoints in the clear arctic sky. A crescent moon hangs low near the horizon, its light adding silver-white illumination to the scene.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Ice particles and snowflakes fill the air — hundreds of tiny ice crystals suspended around her, each one catching the magical blue light and the aurora's green glow, creating a shimmering curtain of frozen light. Her breath is visible — a cloud of fine ice crystals that catch the light. The magical ice structures emanating from her hands radiate a cold, brilliant blue-white light that illuminates her face and body from below, creating dramatic uplighting that contrasts with the softer aurora light from above. Fine snow is falling gently throughout the scene — individual snowflakes visible in the foreground, becoming a soft white haze in the distance. The overall palette is ice blue, silver-white, midnight blue, aurora green, and pale violet — cold but beautiful, like standing inside a diamond.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

Her face occupies roughly the 52%-68% vertical zone. The top 40% contains only the sky, aurora, treetops, and falling snow. No part of her face or body enters the top 35%.

At thumbnail, the bright ice-blue magic and aurora-lit sky create instant visual impact.
