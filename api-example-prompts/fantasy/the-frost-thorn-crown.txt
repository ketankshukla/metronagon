TYPE: Paperback Front Cover

---

A sumptuous book cover rendered in the style of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood — the Victorian art movement known for its jewel-toned colors, obsessive natural detail, flowing compositions, and romantically idealized figures. The painting should look like it belongs in the Tate Gallery alongside works by the great romantic painters of the 1850s-1880s — lush, detailed, emotionally intense, and unapologetically beautiful. Every surface is rendered with botanical precision, every fabric fold is a study in drapery, and the figure at the center radiates the tragic beauty that defined the movement.

THE FIGURE — A FAE QUEEN IN HER WINTER GARDEN:

A single figure dominates the composition — a Fae queen, positioned from approximately 25% to 90% from the top, rendered in full-length, standing in a frozen garden. She faces the viewer in a three-quarter pose, her body angled slightly left, her gaze direct and ancient.

She is extraordinarily beautiful in the Pre-Raphaelite manner: idealized but not generic, with features that suggest otherworldly heritage. Her skin is pale — not sickly but luminous, the translucent porcelain quality that the Pre-Raphaelites favored, with a faint blue undertone that suggests fae blood rather than human circulation. Her face is heart-shaped with high, sharp cheekbones, a delicate pointed chin, and eyes that are the painting's emotional center: large, heavy-lidded, the iris color a pale frost-blue that is almost white, with pupils that are slightly vertically elongated (faintly feline, faintly inhuman). Dark lashes frame these otherworldly eyes. Her expression is complex — melancholy, power, ancient weariness, and a subtle cruelty that lives in the set of her lips and the angle of her brow.

HER HAIR — THE PRE-RAPHAELITE SIGNATURE:

Her hair is the painting's most lavish element — the Pre-Raphaelites were obsessed with hair, and this cover honors that obsession. Her hair is extraordinarily long, flowing from her head in heavy waves that cascade past her waist and pool on the ground around her feet. The color is a deep, rich auburn-copper — not bright red but the deep, warm, red-gold of autumn leaves, each strand individually visible where it catches the light, the mass of hair creating complex patterns of light and shadow. The hair is not neatly arranged — it flows freely, stirred by an unfelt wind, strands crossing her face and shoulders, tendrils reaching outward as though the hair has its own will. Woven through her hair, small ice crystals and frozen flowers glint — tiny points of cold blue-white light against the warm copper. A circlet of thorns — the Frost Thorn Crown — sits atop her head: a crown made from actual frozen blackthorn branches, the thorns long and sharp and coated in hoarfrost, the ice catching the light as tiny prismatic sparkles. Small frozen berries (dark purple-blue, coated in frost) cluster at the crown's temples.

HER GOWN — DRAPERY AS ART:

She wears a gown that is simultaneously medieval and otherworldly — a heavy, flowing garment in deep midnight blue velvet (#1A1A4A) that catches the light with a rich, saturated sheen. The velvet is rendered with the Pre-Raphaelite obsession for fabric texture — every fold and drape is a study in how velvet absorbs and reflects light, with deep shadows of near-black and highlights of silvery blue. The gown's neckline is wide and low, edged with embroidery in silver thread depicting frost fern patterns (the same crystalline branching patterns that form on windowpanes in winter). The sleeves are long and trailing, their hems touching the ground, lined in pale ice-blue silk visible where the sleeves fold back. The bodice is fitted and laced with silver cord. The skirt flows and pools on the frozen ground, its folds arranged with the deliberate grace of Pre-Raphaelite drapery — every fold tells a story, every line guides the eye.

Over the gown, she wears a cloak of white winter fox fur — luxurious, heavy, thrown back over her shoulders, its white fur catching the light with a warm ivory glow. The fur is rendered with individual hair-level detail in the areas closest to the viewer.

THE WINTER GARDEN — PRE-RAPHAELITE NATURE:

She stands in a garden that is frozen at the exact moment between autumn's death and winter's dominion:

Behind her, bare trees with dark, twisted branches reach upward and outward, their limbs coated in a thick layer of crystalline frost that catches the light. The branches are intricately detailed — every twig, every bud, every joint rendered with botanical accuracy. Among the bare branches, the last leaves of autumn cling — deep red, burnt orange, and gold leaves, their edges curled and frosted, depicted with the same obsessive botanical precision that the Pre-Raphaelites brought to every painting.

At her feet, the frozen garden floor: dark earth covered in a thin layer of frost, with scattered fallen leaves frozen in place, clusters of winter berries (deep red holly berries, dark sloe berries), and the brown stalks of dead wildflowers still standing, their seed heads coated in frost like tiny ice sculptures. Among these dead-winter elements, small green shoots push through the frost — snowdrops and winter aconites, their tiny white and yellow flowers perfect and defiant, rendered with botanical-plate precision. These small flowers at the queen's feet suggest that even in her frozen domain, life persists.

A single robin perches on a frost-coated branch near her shoulder — its red breast a vivid warm accent against the cold blues and whites, rendered with ornithological detail.

LIGHTING — COLD AND GOLDEN SIMULTANEOUSLY:

The lighting is complex and dramatic: the primary light comes from a low winter sun (out of frame, to the right), casting warm golden light that catches her hair (turning it to fire), the fox fur (turning it to gold), and the frost on the branches (turning each crystal into a tiny prism). But the overall scene temperature is COLD — the shadows are deep blue-purple, the frost glows with cold blue-white light, and the queen herself seems to emit a subtle aura of cold that dims the warm light nearest to her skin. The interplay of warm golden sunlight and cold fae aura creates the cover's visual tension.

TEXT — ROMANTIC SERIF, ELEGANT AND LITERARY:

Title (positioned at 3-16% from top, centered over the upper bare branches):
"THE FROST THORN" — in an elegant, high-contrast serif font (think Playfair Display or Didot — the kind of serif with dramatic thick-thin variation) in frost blue-white (#D0E8FF). Medium-large, letter-spacing 0.1em. The letters have a subtle crystalline quality — fine, sharp, cold.
"CROWN" — on the next line, same font, LARGER, in deep auburn-copper (#8B3A1A) — the color of the queen's hair. The cold-to-warm title transition mirrors the painting's temperature contrast.

Subtitle (positioned at 18% from top, centered): "A Winter Court Novel" — in small italic serif in silver (#C0C8D0), letter-spacing 0.15em.

Author name (positioned at 91-94% from top, centered over the dark garden floor): "ISOLDE RAVENSCRAFT-OKAFOR" — in elegant serif capitals in frost blue-white (#D0E8FF), letter-spacing 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Romantic, cold, tragically beautiful — the feeling of encountering a being who is exquisite and dangerous and utterly beyond human warmth. The Pre-Raphaelite style transforms dark romantasy into fine art — every detail is rendered with the loving precision of a Victorian master. The frozen garden speaks of power held too long — beauty that kills what it touches.

At thumbnail, the flowing auburn hair and deep blue gown against the frost-white garden create an immediately arresting romantic fantasy image. At full resolution, the individual frost crystals, the botanical precision of the garden plants, the robin's feathers, and the embroidery detail are museum-quality.

THIS IS PRE-RAPHAELITE ROMANTIC PAINTING. Lush, detailed, jewel-toned, emotionally intense. The beauty is in the obsessive natural detail, the flowing hair and drapery, and the tragic romanticism of a figure who is both impossibly beautiful and impossibly cold.
