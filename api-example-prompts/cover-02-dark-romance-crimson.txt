---

A striking, ultra-minimalist book cover that is 90% negative space and typography, with a single photorealistic object as the visual anchor. The design philosophy is ruthless simplicity — everything that is not essential has been removed. Think of the most elegant, high-concept thriller covers: solid background, one object, devastating typography. The overall feel should be that of a premium hardcover from a major publisher — the kind of cover where the designer was paid $10,000 and used 95% of the budget on restraint.

BACKGROUND — ABSOLUTE MATTE BLACK:

The entire background is a deep, rich, absolute matte black (#0A0A0A). Not grey, not charcoal, not dark blue — TRUE black. The black is not flat, however — there is the subtlest suggestion of a very fine grain texture, almost imperceptible, like premium uncoated paper stock. This grain prevents the black from looking like a digital void and instead makes it feel tactile, physical, like you could reach out and feel the matte surface. The black occupies every single pixel of the image that is not text or the central object.

THE OBJECT — A SHATTERED HOURGLASS IN MID-EXPLOSION:

Positioned precisely in the vertical center of the image (centered at approximately 55% from the top), a single hourglass is captured at the exact moment of shattering. The hourglass is rendered with obsessive, jewelry-advertisement-level photorealism — this is the ONLY visual element on the cover and it must be flawless.

The hourglass frame is brushed brass — not shiny gold, but a warm, matte, industrial brass with visible machining marks, subtle fingerprint smudges, and the patina of age. The brass frame is an elegant turned design — classical hourglass shape with decorative turned rings at the waist and flared caps at top and bottom. The frame is intact but the glass is not.

The glass bulbs are in the process of exploding outward — captured in a freeze-frame microsecond. The upper bulb has cracked into seven or eight large shards that are separating outward in a radial pattern, each shard razor-sharp and crystalline, catching the light on its fractured edges. The lower bulb is more intact but a massive crack runs from the waist to the base, with one large triangular shard already detached and floating slightly away. The glass is not ordinary glass — it is rendered as premium crystal, catching and refracting light in prismatic rainbow edges along every fracture line. Tiny fragments of glass dust and splinters surround the larger shards like a halo of crystalline debris, each one catching a pinpoint of light.

THE SAND — THE MOST DRAMATIC ELEMENT:

The sand that was inside the hourglass is mid-escape. It is not ordinary sand — it is vivid, blood-red sand. Deep crimson (#8B0000) grains, thousands of them, rendered individually in the foreground and as a flowing mass further back. The red sand streams and explodes outward from the shattered glass in multiple directions:
- A dense stream pours downward from the broken lower bulb, fanning out like a crimson waterfall dissolving into individual grains at its edges
- A cloud of finer red particles billows upward and outward from the upper bulb explosion, creating a dramatic spray pattern against the black background
- Individual grains are frozen in mid-air around the entire hourglass, each one a tiny point of red against the black — some sharp and in focus (foreground), others softer and smaller (background), creating genuine photographic depth-of-field
- Where the light catches the red sand at certain angles, the grains glow with an internal warmth — almost like tiny embers

The red sand against the matte black background is the cover's entire color story. It is dramatic, violent, and beautiful — the visual equivalent of time itself bleeding out.

LIGHTING — SURGICAL AND DRAMATIC:

A single, hard light source from directly above — like a museum spotlight or an interrogation lamp — illuminates ONLY the hourglass and the sand. The light is cold, white, and precise, creating razor-sharp highlights on the brass frame and the glass shard edges, while the red sand catches the light and glows with warm crimson intensity. The contrast between the cold white highlights on glass/metal and the warm red glow of the sand creates visual tension. The light falls off rapidly — by the time it reaches the edges of the sand cloud, it is absorbed by the black background. There are no secondary light sources, no fill light, no ambient light. Everything beyond the hourglass is pure black. The brass frame casts a subtle shadow downward — but onto what? There is no visible surface beneath the hourglass. It floats in the void.

TEXT — BOLD, MODERN, AGGRESSIVE TYPOGRAPHY. NO SERIFS. NO FLOURISHES. NO ORNAMENTS:

Title (positioned at 8-22% from top, centered): "ZERO" on line one, "HOUR" on line two — in a massive, ultra-bold condensed sans-serif font. Think Bebas Neue Black or Impact at maximum weight — the kind of font that looks like it was stamped with an industrial press. The letters are ENORMOUS — each letter is at least 8% of the image width. The font color is stark white (#FFFFFF) — pure, clean, no glow, no shadow, no effects whatsoever. The power is in the size, the weight, and the contrast against the black. The two words are stacked with very tight leading (line spacing) — barely a pixel of breathing room between "ZERO" and "HOUR." The text should feel like it is pressing down on the hourglass below it with typographic weight.

NO series name. NO subtitle. NO tagline. The absence of additional text is deliberate — it creates unease. Most covers have supporting text; this one refuses to explain itself.

Author name (positioned at 90-93% from top, centered): "DOMINIK VOSS" — in a thin, light-weight sans-serif font (the OPPOSITE of the title — think Montserrat Light or Helvetica Neue Thin). All uppercase, generous letter-spacing (0.4em), approximately 14pt equivalent. The font color is a muted medium grey (#666666) — deliberately understated against the black background, barely visible, forcing the eye to work for it. This contrast between the screaming white title and the whispered grey author name is intentional — the book is the star, not the author.

A single thin horizontal line (1px weight) in the same muted grey (#666666) sits 2% above the author name, width 15% of the image, centered. It is the only decorative element on the entire cover.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Tense, stark, premium — the feeling of a ticking clock in a silent room. This cover communicates one thing: time has run out, and the consequences are about to arrive. The minimalism is aggressive — there is nowhere for the eye to hide. The red-on-black color story is ancient and primal (blood and darkness) but the execution is razor-modern. This cover looks NOTHING like a fantasy cover, nothing like a romance cover, nothing like a literary fiction cover — it is unmistakably a high-concept thriller from the first glance. At thumbnail size, the massive white title and the red splash of sand on black create instant recognition. At full resolution, the photorealistic detail of the hourglass — the brass patina, the crystal fractures, the individual sand grains — rewards extended viewing.

THIS IS MINIMALIST DESIGN. The black space is not empty — it is doing work. Every pixel of black is a deliberate choice. Do not add anything that is not specified. Do not add background textures, gradients, patterns, bokeh, particles, or atmospheric effects beyond what is described. The power of this cover is in what it does NOT show.
