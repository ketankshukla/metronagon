---

A breathtaking ultra-high-resolution photorealistic book cover rendered at 1024x1536 pixels in sharp cinematic digital style with advanced volumetric lighting, candlelight warmth, and dramatic chiaroscuro shadows. This must look like the poster for a dark, sumptuous gothic film — every texture, every fold of fabric, every flicker of flame rendered with obsessive photographic precision. ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting, NO watercolor, NO painterly brushstrokes, NO soft-focus artistic filters. Every pixel must be razor-sharp, hyper-detailed, and dramatically lit.

SUBJECT — DANGEROUS INTIMACY IN A GOTHIC THRONE ROOM:

A devastatingly handsome man of Mediterranean descent in his early 30s, positioned in the lower-right portion of the image, captured in a three-quarter profile view facing left. He sits on a massive throne of black iron and crimson velvet, his posture a study in controlled power — one leg crossed over the other, his left hand resting on the throne's arm with fingers curled loosely around the stem of a crystal goblet filled with deep red wine. He wears a tailored black suit — not modern, not period, something in between — the jacket is structured with subtle brocade texture in matte black-on-black, the collar high and sharp. Beneath it, a deep crimson silk shirt, the top three buttons undone, revealing the edge of a scar that runs diagonally across his collarbone. No tie. A single ring on his right hand — a heavy signet ring of blackened silver with a ruby the color of arterial blood.

FACE — PHOTOREALISTIC DARK BEAUTY:

His face is the centerpiece and must be rendered with obsessive photorealism. Strong Mediterranean bone structure — a sharp, angular jaw darkened with precisely groomed stubble, high cheekbones that create deep hollows beneath, a straight nose with a slight aquiline bridge that speaks of old aristocratic bloodlines. His skin is warm olive-toned, flawless but lived-in — a thin scar bisects his right eyebrow, another faint one traces his jawline near his ear. His eyes are extraordinary — deep amber-brown with flecks of molten gold that catch the candlelight and seem to burn from within. His gaze is directed slightly off-camera to the left, heavy-lidded and intense — the look of a man who is used to being obeyed. Dark brows, strong and expressive, one slightly raised in what might be amusement or challenge. His hair is dark espresso-brown, thick and slightly wavy, swept back from his forehead with a few strands falling forward over his left temple. The candlelight catches warm auburn highlights in the waves. His lips are full, the lower lip slightly heavier, set in a line that hovers between a smirk and something more dangerous. He is beautiful the way a blade is beautiful — sharp, controlled, and capable of damage.

BACKGROUND — GOTHIC THRONE ROOM:

The throne room is vast and dark, rendered in deep shadows pierced by warm candlelight. Enormous stone walls rise into shadow, covered in dark tapestries embroidered with thorned rose motifs in deep crimson and gold thread. Dozens of black iron candelabras — tall, twisted, gothic — hold clusters of ivory candles whose flames flicker and cast dancing shadows across every surface. The floor is polished black marble veined with crimson, reflecting the candlelight in warm pools. Behind the throne, a massive stained-glass window depicts intertwined thorned roses and daggers in deep ruby red, blood orange, and midnight blue — the glass catches the light from behind (moonlight) and casts colored light patterns across the floor and the edges of the throne. Crimson rose petals are scattered across the marble floor — some fresh, some withered and darkened. A single thorned rose stem lies across the left arm of the throne, its petals impossibly deep red, almost black at the edges, with a single drop of blood on one of the thorns.

ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS:

Warm candlelight dominates the scene — amber, gold, and deep warm orange — creating rich chiaroscuro across the man's face and suit. The overall palette is crimson, black, and gold with accents of deep burgundy and midnight blue. Fine dust motes drift through the shafts of candlelight. Thin wisps of smoke from recently extinguished candles curl through the upper portion of the scene. The mood is intoxicating — dangerous luxury, controlled passion, the moment before something irreversible happens.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:

The man's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. His face occupies roughly the 50%-72% vertical zone of the image. The top 40% of the image must contain ONLY background elements — the upper portions of the throne room, stained glass, candelabras, stone walls. NO part of his face or body enters the top 35%.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED:

Line 1 (exactly 3% from top): "A THRONE OF THORNS NOVEL" — small elegant serif font (Cormorant Garamond style), centered, gold color (#D4AF37), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt.

Line 2 (exactly 6% from top): "BOOK I" — serif font, centered, crimson color (#8B0000), letter-spacing 0.2em, approximately 12pt. Flanked by thin horizontal gold ornamental lines.

Lines 3-4 (title block, exactly 10-22% from top): "CRIMSON VOWS" — large, elegant serif font, centered, white/cream with a subtle warm gold glow. "CRIMSON" rendered significantly larger than "VOWS." The letters have a luxurious quality — subtle gold highlight on upper edges, faint shadow beneath.

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 24% from top): An elegant gold filigree divider — thorned rose vine motif with small crimson rose blooms at the center, tendrils extending symmetrically to each side.

Line 5 (exactly 26% from top): "He offered her everything. The price was her soul." — smaller italic serif, centered, pale gold/cream color with a soft warm glow.

Line 6 (exactly 92% from top): "ISABELLE MARCHETTI" — large serif font, centered, white/cream with generous letter-spacing 0.2em. Elegant and refined.

OVERALL MOOD:

Dark, sumptuous, intoxicating — the feeling of being drawn into something beautiful and dangerous. This is not horror — it is desire wrapped in shadow and thorns. The cover should make a romance reader's heart rate increase. Stunning at thumbnail (the crimson-and-black contrast pops) and breathtaking at full resolution.

ABSOLUTELY NO oil painting texture. NO watercolor. NO canvas grain. PHOTOREALISTIC CINEMATIC DIGITAL ART.
