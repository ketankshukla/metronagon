A single accent color (clinical red) appears in the hidden imagery.

---

A striking, unsettling book cover composed of a single large Rorschach-style inkblot — a bilaterally symmetrical pattern of black ink on white paper that appears abstract at first glance but reveals disturbing hidden imagery to the patient viewer. The inkblot is rendered with the authentic characteristics of a real Rorschach test card: the organic, cloud-like edges where ink has spread along paper fibers; the variation in ink density from deep opaque black at the centers to grey translucent areas at the edges; and the perfect bilateral symmetry created by folding wet paper. This is psychological horror rendered as clinical testing material.

THE INKBLOT (centered, filling 20-85% from top):

A single massive inkblot dominates the cover — approximately 80% of the image width and 65% of the image height. The inkblot is bilaterally symmetrical along a vertical center axis (the fold line). The overall shape is vaguely humanoid but organic and ambiguous — the Rorschach test's power lies in its deliberate ambiguity, and this inkblot maintains that quality while hiding specific imagery within its forms.

INK CHARACTERISTICS:
- DEEP BLACK CENTERS: The thickest ink deposits (#0A0A0A) are at and near the center fold line, where the most ink was deposited. These areas are opaque, dense, and sharp-edged.
- GREY GRADIENTS: Moving outward from the center, the ink thins — spreading along paper fibers to create areas of varied density from dark grey (#404040) to pale grey (#A0A0A0). These gradient areas are where the hidden imagery is most visible — the brain searches these ambiguous grey zones for patterns.
- ORGANIC EDGES: The inkblot's outer edges are NOT smooth — they are the ragged, unpredictable edges of ink spreading on damp paper: branching, fingering, with tiny satellite droplets scattered beyond the main form. These organic edges give the inkblot its characteristic living, breathing quality.
- FOLD LINE: A subtle vertical line runs through the center — the crease where the paper was folded while the ink was wet. This fold line is visible as a very thin bright white line through the darkest ink, and as a slight mirror-axis artifact in the symmetry.

THE HIDDEN IMAGERY (visible on close inspection):

Within the ambiguous forms of the inkblot, carefully composed imagery becomes apparent — the kind of shapes that a viewer's brain would "find" in a real Rorschach test, but deliberately placed by the artist:

- TWO FACES IN PROFILE: In the upper portion of the inkblot (25-40% from top), the negative space between two symmetrical ink lobes creates the silhouette of two human faces in profile, facing each other across the fold line. The faces are not drawn — they are formed by the ABSENCE of ink, the white paper showing through between ink masses. The profiles suggest a man and a woman, or the same person facing themselves. This is the most prominent hidden image.

- A BUTTERFLY OR MOTH: The middle section of the inkblot (40-55% from top), where two wing-like extensions spread symmetrically outward, resembles a large butterfly or moth with spread wings. The wing edges are detailed with the organic fringing of real ink spread, suggesting wing scales. This is a classic Rorschach response — moths and butterflies are the most commonly reported images.

- HANDS REACHING: In the lower portion (55-70% from top), two symmetrical forms extend downward and outward — they can be read as reaching hands, with finger-like ink projections. The hands reach toward the bottom of the image, creating a sense of grasping or falling.

- THE HIDDEN FIGURE: The most disturbing hidden image — visible only on extended study. In the very center of the inkblot, where the ink is densest and blackest, the faintest outline of a standing figure is embedded. This figure is rendered not in ink but in a SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BLACK — perhaps 5% lighter than the surrounding ink (#151515 against #0A0A0A), barely perceptible. The figure is humanoid, standing, facing the viewer. It is the patient. Or the doctor. Or the thing the patient sees when they look at the inkblot. It is almost invisible — many viewers will never find it. Those who do will find it deeply unsettling.

THE RED ACCENT:

In two symmetrical locations within the inkblot (approximately where the "butterfly's" body would be, at the center-fold), small areas of deep clinical red (#8B1A1A) ink appear — as though a second color of ink was added to the test card. In real Rorschach testing, Cards II and III include red ink, and its presence changes the psychological response. The red here reads as blood, passion, or danger — a warm, visceral interruption in the cold black-and-white clinical image. The red areas are small (perhaps 3-4% of the total inkblot area) but vivid against the monochrome.

THE PAPER BACKGROUND:

The background is NOT pure white but the slightly warm, slightly textured surface of heavyweight testing paper — a warm white (#FFF8F0) with very subtle fiber texture visible. The paper surface shows faint handling marks — the slight darkening along the edges where many hands have held the test card, and a tiny crease in the upper-left corner suggesting the card has been used and reused.

COLOR PALETTE — CLINICAL:

- Dense ink black: #0A0A0A — inkblot core
- Mid-grey ink: #404040 to #A0A0A0 — inkblot gradients
- Clinical red: #8B1A1A — accent color, symmetrical patches
- Testing paper white: #FFF8F0 — background
- Hidden figure dark: #151515 — barely perceptible center figure

TEXT — CLINICAL PRECISION:

Title (positioned at 5-16% from top, centered above the inkblot):
"THE RORSCHACH" — in a clean, clinical sans-serif font (think Helvetica Neue, Arial, or DIN — the fonts of medical forms and institutional documents) in black (#0A0A0A). Medium-large, letter-spacing 0.1em. The clinical font choice reinforces the psychological testing theme.
"PATIENT" — on the next line, same font, same size, in clinical red (#8B1A1A). The shift from black to red mirrors the inkblot's color scheme and signals danger emerging from clinical restraint.

Subtitle (positioned at 18% from top, centered): "A PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER" — in small, thin sans-serif in mid-grey (#606060), letter-spacing 0.3em. Clinical, restrained, institutional.

Author name (positioned at 88-92% from top, centered below the inkblot): "DR. MAREN VOGT-OKAFOR" — in thin sans-serif in black (#0A0A0A), letter-spacing 0.25em. The "Dr." adds clinical authority.

In the bottom margin, very small: a fictional test reference — "PLATE XI — RESTRICTED CLINICAL USE ONLY" in tiny grey (#A0A0A0) sans-serif. This detail completes the illusion that the cover is an actual psychological test card.

OVERALL MOOD:

Clinical, unsettling, intellectually disturbing — the feeling of staring at a Rorschach card and realizing that what you see in it reveals something about YOU that you'd rather not know. The inkblot cover is psychologically interactive — every viewer will find different images in its forms, and that personal discovery is itself a small, uncomfortable psychological experience. The hidden figures reward extended study but also punish it — the more you look, the more disturbing images you find.

THIS IS RORSCHACH INKBLOT ART. Symmetrical, organic, clinically precise. Black ink on white paper with hidden bilateral imagery. The beauty is in the ambiguity — the image means nothing and everything simultaneously, and what you see in it says more about you than about the image.
