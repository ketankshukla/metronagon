# Metronagon Media — Services & Pricing (Reedsy‑Aligned, Beginner‑Friendly)

**Positioning (use on the page):**

**How you’ll look “premium” while still landing first clients:**
- Publish **Reedsy‑aligned list prices** (signals quality).
- Offer a **limited Founder Pricing** discount (signals new studio / early slots, not “cheap work”).

## AI Transparency (Reedsy‑style policy)
**Use this exact section on the page:**
> We may use generative‑AI tools as part of the concepting and/or image‑creation workflow. If AI is used, it will be disclosed upfront, the scope will be clearly defined, and we will proceed only with your written consent.

---

## Why this structure works (the reasoning)
- Your old prices signaled “cheap.” These prices signal **professional marketplace level**.
- You’re not a beginner creator — you’re **a new service provider with real proof-of-work** (22 published titles + examples). That is legitimate credibility.
- Founder Pricing gives you a controlled way to land early clients **without anchoring your brand low**.
- Packages are built around deliverables clients understand: **ebook cover vs full wrap**, **series system**, and **launch assets**.
