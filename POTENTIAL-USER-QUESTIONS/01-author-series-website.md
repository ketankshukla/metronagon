# Question: "Can you build me a website like this for my book series?"

## Your Answer — Copy-Paste Ready Pitch

Yes — this is something I build specifically for authors, and what you're seeing on my series sites is exactly what you'd get: a professionally designed, fully custom author website built around your book series, your covers, and your brand identity.

Here's what every site includes as standard:

**The Hero Section** displays your series logo at full scale with a full-width panoramic box set cover image underneath it — the kind of first impression that makes a visitor understand immediately that this is a serious, professional series. Every element is animated on scroll and renders perfectly on mobile and tablet.

**The Books Section** shows all your covers in a responsive grid. Each cover is clickable and opens a full-screen book modal with: your cover at full size, an epigraph or chapter quote, a detailed description, a complete chapter-by-chapter breakdown, and Amazon buy buttons for both the individual book and the full series. Readers can navigate between books without closing the modal. It's the kind of interactive experience that keeps visitors on the page and drives them toward purchase.

**The Author Section** includes your bio, a professional photo, a stats grid (books, chapters, whatever key numbers tell your story), and a visual breakdown of your series structure — what each book is about and how it fits into the larger arc.

**Platform & Protection:** The site is built in Next.js, deployed to Vercel, and ready for a custom domain. All images are protected against right-click saving and drag-to-desktop — your cover art stays yours. The site scores well on Core Web Vitals, loads fast, and is mobile-first by design.

**Optional Add-Ons** I can include based on your series:

- **Character Grid + Character Modals:** If your series has a cast of characters (as I did with my 30-character Aztec Samurai Adventures site), I build a full character gallery. Each character card is clickable and opens a detailed profile with their portrait, alignment badge, quote, backstory, physical description, abilities, character arc, and key relationships. This turns your website into a world-building experience your readers will come back to.

- **Embedded YouTube Player:** A custom-built YouTube player with your series thumbnail overlay, smooth play/pause controls, and no YouTube UI chrome. Ideal if you have a book trailer, author interview, or series promo video.

The end result is a standalone website for your series — not a generic author site with a list of books, but a dedicated world for your series that works as a marketing tool, a reader resource, and a professional presence all in one.

My own three published series each have dedicated sites: Aztec Samurai Adventures at aztec.ketanshukla.com, Repetition: Mother of Mastery at repetition.ketanshukla.com, and Reality Without Belief at reality.ketanshukla.com. These are live examples you can explore right now — the exact quality and feature set you'd receive.

To get started, I'd need your series covers (or we can design them as part of a package), your author photo, your series logo (or I create it), and a brief on your series. Timeline is typically 5–10 business days from asset delivery. Would you like to discuss your series?

## Notes for You (Internal Use)

- Reference your three live sites as proof — they're the single strongest sales tool for this service
- The character grid is a massive differentiator for fiction authors; emphasize how it turns a website into a world experience
- Authors who have already purchased branding or pipeline packages from you have all their assets ready — upsell the website as the natural next step
- Custom pricing is appropriate for unusually large series (12+ books, 50+ characters) — quote those on a project basis
- If the author already has covers but wants the site, price based on features only; if they need covers too, bundle with a branding package for a discount
