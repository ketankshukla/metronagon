# Question: "Can you make a book trailer or promotional video for my series?"

## Your Answer — Copy-Paste Ready Pitch

Yes — book trailers are a service I offer, and the key difference between a professional trailer and a slideshow of cover images set to music is this: a real book trailer sells an emotional experience, not a product listing.

Most book trailers on YouTube fail for the same reason most back-cover blurbs fail — they describe the book instead of making the viewer feel something. A viewer who finishes watching a good book trailer should feel a pull toward the book that they didn't have 60 seconds ago. That's the only metric that matters.

Here's how I approach a book trailer:

**The Structure:**
A professional 60-second trailer has three acts. Act one establishes the world — two or three seconds of imagery that signal genre, tone, and stakes without explaining anything. Act two introduces tension — the protagonist, the problem, the choice they face — built through carefully timed text cards and visual transitions, not narration. Act three is the hook — the unresolved question that makes a viewer reach for the "Buy now" link. The series title and cover appear last, not first.

**The Visual Language:**
Every frame uses imagery and color pulled from your series' visual world — specifically from the covers I designed. Your cover art becomes the foundation of the trailer's aesthetic. Typography matches your series logo and cover fonts. Music is licensed for commercial use.

**The YouTube Integration:**
I've built a custom YouTube player (you can see it embedded on the Repetition: Mother of Mastery and Reality Without Belief sites) that displays your trailer with a series-branded thumbnail overlay and no YouTube UI chrome. If you have an author website, your trailer integrates cleanly into it.

**Formats Delivered:**
- 16:9 MP4 for YouTube (1920×1080)
- 9:16 vertical crop for Instagram Reels and TikTok
- 1:1 square crop for Facebook and Instagram feed

**What I need from you:** Your cover files, series logo, any character imagery or world-building visuals you have, a brief on your book's central conflict and emotional tone, and any quotes from advance readers you want featured.

**Turnaround:** 5–7 business days.

## Notes for You (Internal Use)

- The YouTube player component is already built and tested — you've used it on two of your own sites. Integration into any author website you've built for a client is minimal additional work but high perceived value
- Licensed music is available through royalty-free libraries (Epidemic Sound, Artlist) — either include a subscription cost in your pricing or use stock tracks you already have access to; factor this into your margin
- The biggest objection to book trailers is "do they actually sell books?" — the honest answer is that a bad trailer doesn't, but a good one builds brand awareness and gives authors a shareable marketing asset for launch week. Frame it as a launch asset, not a direct sales tool.
- TikTok is increasingly important for fiction (especially fantasy) — the vertical cut add-on is an easy yes for authors who know BookTok exists
- For authors who have purchased the author website from you, the YouTube player integration is a $200 add-on that takes you maybe an hour — price reflects value, not time
