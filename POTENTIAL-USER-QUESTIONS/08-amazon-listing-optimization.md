# Question: "Can you optimize my Amazon listing — keywords, categories, and description formatting?"

## Your Answer — Copy-Paste Ready Pitch

Yes — and Amazon listing optimization is one of those services that pays for itself immediately. An unoptimized listing is a book that's invisible to the readers who would buy it. An optimized listing puts your book in front of the right search queries, signals the right genre to Amazon's recommendation algorithm, and converts browsers into buyers once they land on your page.

Here's what full Amazon listing optimization covers:

**Keywords (the backend):**
Amazon KDP gives you 7 keyword fields, each holding up to 50 characters. Most authors use obvious single words like "fantasy" or "thriller" — which is exactly what every other book in your genre uses, and where you have zero chance of ranking. The strategy is keyword phrases: 3–5 word combinations that match specific reader search behavior (e.g., "aztec mythology fantasy novel," "warrior samurai adventure series," "self-help habit building books"). I research your genre's actual search terms, construct phrases that fit within the character limits, and prioritize phrases with meaningful traffic but manageable competition.

**Categories (the placement):**
Amazon allows 2 categories at upload, but if you email KDP directly, you can request up to 10. Most authors don't know this. The right categories put your book in front of readers who are already browsing for exactly your type of story — and in smaller sub-categories, a book can reach #1 bestseller in its category with far fewer sales than the top-level Fiction > Fantasy path. I identify your optimal categories for both initial upload and the additional requests.

**Description Formatting (the HTML layer):**
Amazon description fields accept a subset of HTML tags — bold, italic, headings, line breaks — but KDP's description editor hides this. A well-formatted description uses bold for key phrases, line breaks for readability, and structural hierarchy to make the page scannable. A wall of plain text performs worse than a formatted description that guides the reader's eye. I format your description using Amazon's supported HTML tags for maximum impact.

**A+ Content:**
If you're enrolled in KDP Select or publishing through KDP in general, you're eligible for A+ Content — an enhanced product page section below your description where you can add additional images, comparison tables, and secondary copy. I write and format A+ Content that extends your book's story and reinforces purchase intent.

**What I need from you:** Your book's genre, subgenre, target audience, and any marketing copy you already have. I'll handle the keyword research, category identification, description formatting, and A+ content copy from there.

## Notes for You (Internal Use)

- The "up to 10 categories via email to KDP" trick is a genuine value add that many experienced authors don't know about — mentioning it upfront positions you as an expert, not just a service provider
- Keywords need refreshing every 6–12 months as search trends shift — the Keyword Refresh service creates a recurring revenue stream from existing clients
- A+ Content is only available to authors enrolled in KDP Select or Brand Registry — if the client is wide (selling on multiple retailers), A+ Content isn't available; adjust accordingly
- The Pipeline packages already include book descriptions — but they don't include keyword research, category strategy, or A+ Content. This service is a natural add-on for Pipeline clients who want the full Amazon presence
- For non-fiction authors, category strategy is especially powerful — self-help sub-categories are highly specific and an optimized placement can produce a legitimate "bestseller" badge
