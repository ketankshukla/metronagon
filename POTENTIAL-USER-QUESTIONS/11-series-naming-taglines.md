## Your Answer — Copy-Paste Ready Pitch

Yes — series naming and tagline development is creative work that sits at the intersection of branding, marketing, and storytelling, and it's something I approach with the same rigor I bring to visual design.

Most authors treat their series name as an afterthought — they use their protagonist's name, a location from the story, or a generic descriptor. What they don't consider is that a series name is a brand asset. It needs to be searchable, memorable, genre-appropriate, visually workable as a logo, and distinctive enough that it doesn't blend into the hundreds of other series in its category. "The Chronicles of [Character Name]" is a series name. "Aztec Samurai Adventures" is a brand.

**What the naming process looks like:**

I start with a thorough brief: your series premise, your target readership, your genre and subgenre, the emotional tone of the story, any existing names or directions you've explored, and what you want readers to feel when they hear the series name for the first time.

From there I develop a shortlist of 10–15 candidates across three directions:

- **Descriptive names** — names that directly reference the world, the conflict, or the premise (e.g., "The Ember Throne Saga," "Children of the Obsidian Gate")
- **Evocative names** — names that create an atmosphere or feeling without being literal (e.g., "Fractured Meridian," "The Last Glass Hours")
- **Character-anchored names** — names that center the protagonist or central figure in a way that feels iconic rather than generic (e.g., "The Kira Ascending Series")

I present the shortlist with rationale for each name — why it works, how it would appear on a cover, how it performs as a searchable term on Amazon, and how it could expand as a logo or brand mark.

**The tagline layer:**

Once a name is selected, I develop 5–7 tagline options — short phrases that sit below the series name in marketing materials and sum up the promise of the series. A great tagline is 5–8 words, creates intrigue without revealing plot, and functions as a one-line pitch to a new reader. Examples of the type of taglines I develop:

- "Twelve books. One war. No survivors."
- "Where ancient empires and samurai honor collide."
- "Power is not given. It is repeated."

**Book subtitle development (optional):**

If your series also needs individual book subtitles — not just a series name — I develop a naming system where every subtitle uses the same structural logic (e.g., "The [Noun] of [Noun]" format) so the full series listing on Amazon looks intentional and unified.

**Turnaround:** 3 business days for the naming shortlist + tagline presentation. 1 additional business day for revisions and final selection support.

## Notes for You (Internal Use)

- This service is most valuable at the very beginning of a project — before the covers are designed, because the series name directly informs the logo design and cover typography
- If an author is purchasing a branding or pipeline package, offer the naming service as a pre-package add-on — it makes the entire downstream work better
- Trademark checks are not included in this service — advise clients to verify their chosen name through USPTO.gov or their country's trademark database before committing
- Amazon searchability matters: a series name with 0 Amazon results for that exact phrase is a blank slate; a name that returns 10,000 results is crowded. Mention that you consider this in your candidate development — it's a differentiator from a purely creative naming service
- The "Complete Naming Package" is your best offer here — once an author understands that their individual book subtitles should follow a unified structural logic, they immediately see the value of planning all of them together
