# Question: "Can you write my author bio?"

---

## Your Answer — Copy-Paste Ready Pitch

Yes — and an author bio is one of those pieces of writing that sounds simple until you try to do it for yourself. When you write your own bio, you either undersell (leaving out accomplishments because they feel like bragging) or oversell (listing credentials that don't mean anything to a reader). A well-written author bio does neither. It does exactly one thing: gives a potential reader enough reason to trust you and enough personality to want to spend time in your world.

I write author bios in three formats because each one is used differently:

**Short Bio (50–75 words):** Used at the end of Amazon descriptions, in ebook back matter, and in press releases. Every word earns its place. It typically opens with your name and genre position, includes one or two specific credentials, and closes with a human detail that creates connection — something unexpected, personal, or memorable. This is the bio that most readers will actually see, so it's the most important one.

**Medium Bio (150–200 words):** Used on your Amazon Author Central page, your author website, your Reedsy profile, and social media "About" sections. Has room for a brief backstory, a description of your writing style or thematic interests, and a list of your published works or series.

**Long Bio (300+ words):** Used for press kits, speaking engagements, podcast guest appearances, and media inquiries. The full version of your professional story, written in a way that a journalist or podcast host can excerpt directly.

I'm a published author with 22 books across three series — I've written my own author bio more times than I can count, across multiple genre contexts (fantasy fiction, non-fiction self-help, philosophical essays). I know what works in each genre because I've written in all of them.

**What I need from you:** A few bullet points about your background, your published works, your writing history (how long you've been writing, what led you to this genre), and any personal details you're comfortable sharing publicly (where you live, what else you do, any unusual credentials or life experiences that shaped your writing). From there, I'll write all three formats in a single session.

## Notes for You (Internal Use)

- The Full Bio Package is the easy upsell here — most authors realize they need all three versions once you explain where each one is used. Price it as a bundle to make the decision simple.
- The Amazon Author Central Setup add-on is genuinely valuable — many authors have never configured their Author Central page (author photo, bio, book list, blog feed). Offering to set it all up at once is a meaningful service they'll appreciate.
- Author bios for non-fiction authors are different from fiction bios — non-fiction bios lean harder on credentials and expertise ("why should I listen to you?"), while fiction bios lean on personality and genre fit ("what kind of stories do you tell?"). Adjust your approach accordingly.
- For authors who are just starting out and don't have many credentials, focus on passion, specificity, and authenticity — a compelling "I've wanted to write this story for 15 years" is more persuasive than a list of writing courses taken
- Reedsy profile bios (from your REEDSY.md guide) are a specific format you can also offer as a standalone service for designers, editors, and other publishing professionals on the platform — not just authors
