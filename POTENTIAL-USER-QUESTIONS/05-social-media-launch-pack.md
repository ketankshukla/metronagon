# Question: "Can you create social media graphics for my book launch?"

## Your Answer — Copy-Paste Ready Pitch

Yes — and a social media launch pack is something most authors either skip entirely or do badly, which means a professionally built pack is an immediate differentiator for your launch.

The problem with DIY social graphics is that they look like Canva. Even when authors use their own cover, the sizing is wrong, the fonts don't match, the colors are slightly off, and the overall result doesn't look like it belongs to the same visual world as the cover. Readers notice this, even if they can't articulate why. A cohesive launch pack makes your series look like a professional release — not a self-published book.

**What a proper social media launch pack includes:**

Every graphic is built from your series visual language — the same fonts, color palette, and compositional style as your covers. If I designed your covers, I already have the style guide. If someone else designed them, I'll reverse-engineer the visual language from your existing assets.

**The Standard Pack (12 graphics)** covers your essential platforms:
- Instagram square post (1080×1080) — 3 variants: cover reveal, quote card, launch day announcement
- Instagram story (1080×1920) — 2 variants: swipe-up teaser and countdown
- Facebook post (1200×630) — 2 variants: launch announcement and series promo
- Twitter/X header (1500×500) — author banner with series branding
- Twitter/X post graphic (1200×675) — cover + hook text
- YouTube thumbnail (1280×720) — matching your series visual language
- Amazon Author Central banner (1600×400) — professional header for your author page
- Pinterest pin (1000×1500) — tall format for book discovery

**The Premium Pack (20+ graphics)** adds:
- Animated story frame (Reel-ready still or looping GIF)
- 5 additional quote card variants using character quotes or chapter lines
- ARC reader kit graphic — a professional image for announcing advanced reader copies
- Email header graphic (600px wide) for Mailchimp or ConvertKit

Every file is delivered at the correct resolution for its platform, in both PNG and JPG formats where applicable. Naming convention is clear (e.g., `instagram-square-cover-reveal.png`) so you know exactly what you're uploading and where.

**Turnaround:** 3–4 business days for the Standard Pack, 5–7 business days for the Premium Pack.

**What I need from you:** Your cover files (or I use the ones I already designed), your series logo, a list of any specific quotes you want featured, your launch date, and any links you want included in story graphics.

## Notes for You (Internal Use)

- This is a perfect upsell for any author who has just received their covers — they're in launch mode and need the marketing assets to match
- The YouTube thumbnail is already part of some branding packages (Standard and Premium) — don't double-charge; offer the rest of the social pack as an add-on
- Amazon Author Central banner is genuinely valuable and most authors don't even know it exists — mentioning it in the pitch positions you as someone who understands the full author marketing ecosystem
- For authors who already have Canva-designed graphics they're unhappy with, frame this as a "professional rebrand" rather than a replacement — the emotional hook is "your series deserves better than this"
- If the author is planning a series, pitch the Series Launch Bundle — it's actually cheaper than buying three Standard Packs separately, which makes it an easy yes
