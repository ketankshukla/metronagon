# Question: "Can you design an audiobook cover?"

## Your Answer — Copy-Paste Ready Pitch

Yes — audiobook covers are a service I offer both as add-ons to existing cover designs and as standalone projects.

Here's what most authors don't realize: an audiobook cover is not the same file as your ebook cover. ACX (Audible's distribution arm) and other audiobook platforms have their own specific requirements, and submitting your ebook cover without adjustments will typically result in file rejection or a cover that looks wrong at the sizes audiobook platforms display them.

**The technical requirements:**

ACX requires a minimum of 2400×2400 pixels at 72 DPI (or higher), JPEG format, under 5MB file size, and a square aspect ratio. This is fundamentally different from an ebook cover's 2:3 portrait format. If your ebook cover has a vertical composition (portrait orientation), the square crop needs to be thoughtfully rethought — not just mechanically cropped.

**What I do:**

If I designed your ebook cover: I adapt the composition into a square format that preserves the most visually compelling elements — typically the primary character or focal image, the title, and the series logo — recomposed for the square canvas. This isn't a crop. It's a deliberate redesign of the composition within the square constraint, maintaining the visual style and color treatment of the original.

If someone else designed your ebook cover: Send me the highest-resolution file you have and I'll assess whether it can be adapted or whether a fresh approach makes more sense. Most ebook covers can be adapted; occasionally a vertical composition is so committed to its tall proportions that a new design is cleaner.

**Audiobook-specific considerations:**

Audiobook covers are typically displayed at sizes much smaller than ebook covers on most platforms — especially on Audible's browse pages. Your title text needs to be large enough to read at small sizes, which sometimes means slightly larger type than the ebook version. I adjust for this.

**Turnaround:** 1 business day for an adaptation of an existing cover. 2–3 business days for a new design.

## Notes for You (Internal Use)

- Audiobook cover adaptation is one of the highest-margin services by time — adapting an existing cover you designed takes 30–60 minutes of actual work; price reflects the value of the end product, not the time
- ACX also has a separate audiobook narration marketplace; some authors ask about narration. That's not your service — focus on the visual side only
- For authors who haven't recorded their audiobook yet but plan to, the cover is often the last thing they think about — positioning it as something to prepare in advance (before ACX submission) helps move the timeline forward
- ACX/Audible is Amazon's audiobook marketplace — positioning your audiobook there places it directly on Amazon and Audible, which are the dominant audiobook discovery platforms. The ACX cover spec is the standard to design to.
- Mention that you've been through the publishing process yourself with multiple books — even if you haven't produced an audiobook version, your understanding of the full publishing workflow positions you credibly
