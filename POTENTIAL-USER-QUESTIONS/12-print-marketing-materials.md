# Question: "Can you design bookmarks, posters, or other physical marketing materials?"

---

## Your Answer — Copy-Paste Ready Pitch

Yes — physical marketing materials are something I design for authors who want to show up at book fairs, author events, signings, and conventions with professional-quality collateral, or who want to send ARC reader kits with branded inserts.

The same principle applies here as everywhere else in the Metronagon pipeline: every physical piece is designed from your series' established visual language — the same color palette, typography, and imagery as your covers and logo. A bookmark that matches your cover perfectly looks intentional and professional. A bookmark that was designed separately looks like an afterthought.

**What I design:**

**Bookmarks (2" × 7" standard, double-sided):**
Front: your cover image or a key character portrait, series logo, and one evocative tagline. Back: your author bio (short version), a list of all books in the series, your website URL, and a QR code linked to your Amazon author page or series landing page. Print-ready PDF at 300 DPI with 0.125" bleed. File ready for Vistaprint, Canva Print, Moo, or any local printer.

**Posters (8.5" × 11" / 11" × 17" / 18" × 24"):**
Series promo poster featuring your panoramic box set cover or a character-centered composition. Suitable for convention display, bookstore placement, or framed author event signage. Print-ready PDF at 300 DPI.

**Postcards (4" × 6" standard, double-sided):**
Front: cover art or character portrait. Back: short description hook, series listing, website, and QR code. Sized for direct mail campaigns or ARC kit inserts.

**ARC (Advance Reader Copy) Kit Insert:**
A single branded card (4" × 6" or 5" × 7") designed to include with your ARC copies, containing a personal message from the author, a link to leave a review, and your series branding. Sets a professional tone for your ARC reader program and signals that you take your launch seriously.

**Table Display Banner (for author events):**
A 2" × 6" retractable banner design (print file only — printing and hardware are sourced separately by you) featuring your series branding, key covers, and author contact information. The single most impactful item at an author event table.

**QR Code generation:** Included with any print piece — I link it to your Amazon author page, your author website, or any URL you specify.

**Turnaround:** 2–3 business days per piece, depending on complexity.

## Notes for You (Internal Use)

- You design the files only — you don't handle printing or shipping. Always clarify this upfront so there's no expectation management issue
- Recommend specific printers based on the piece: Moo for premium business cards and postcards, Vistaprint for bulk bookmarks and banners, GotPrint for large format posters
- QR code generation is free and takes 2 minutes — include it as a value-added feature, not a line item
- ARC kit inserts are becoming standard practice in the indie publishing community; any author who knows what an ARC is will immediately understand why a professional insert matters
- The Table Display Banner is your highest-margin item if the author is doing events — it's a critical piece and authors know it, which makes it an easy sell
- For series with multiple books, the "series set" (e.g., one bookmark per book in a matching design) is a powerful collector's item for readers and a distinctive piece for event tables
