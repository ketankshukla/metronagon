# Question: "Can you create character portraits like the ones on your Aztec site?"

## Your Answer — Copy-Paste Ready Pitch

Yes — the character portraits you see on the Aztec Samurai Adventures site are a service I offer, and they represent one of the most powerful engagement tools a fiction author can have.

Here's what makes a character portrait different from general illustration: it has to be consistent with your world. The lighting, color palette, rendering style, and clothing details all need to feel like they belong to the same universe as your book covers. A character portrait that doesn't match your cover art visually breaks the reader's immersion — they're looking at two different artistic worlds and something feels off even if they can't say why.

Because I designed your covers (or can design them), I build character portraits directly from the same visual language. The same color grading, the same stylistic rendering, the same post-processing treatment. When readers browse your character gallery, everything coheres. It looks like a world — not a collection of unrelated illustrations.

**What each character portrait includes:**

- Full 2:3 portrait format (the same aspect ratio as your book covers), rendered at high resolution
- Character-specific color palette pulled from your series' established color system
- Costume and equipment details matching your written descriptions or your brief
- Expression and pose that reflects the character's personality and role in the story
- Name overlay and title text in your series' typeface (matching the character grid style)
- Delivered as high-res PNG for website use and JPG for social media and Amazon marketing

For the Aztec Samurai Adventures site, I produced 30 character portraits — heroes, villains, neutral figures, and cosmic entities — each with a distinct alignment color (emerald for heroes, red for villains, amber for neutral, purple for cosmic). The character modal behind each portrait includes their backstory, physical description, abilities, character arc, and key relationships. That level of reader engagement doesn't happen with a list of character names on a static page.

**What I need from you:** Character descriptions from your manuscript (physical appearance, personality, role, any costume details), your cover files so I can match the visual style, and a list of characters ranked by importance so we prioritize the right ones first.

**Turnaround:** 1–2 business days per character. Batch orders are more efficient — a 10-portrait order takes 7 business days, not 20.

## Notes for You (Internal Use)

- The Aztec Samurai Adventures site is your demo — point authors directly to aztec.ketanshukla.com and let the character grid sell itself
- The character modal content writing (+$40/character) is a strong upsell — most authors will want the full interactive experience, not just the images
- If an author already has a website from you, the character grid integration is an easy add-on to pitch
- Authors who are building a series and are early in the writing process often haven't finalized character descriptions yet — offer to work from a brief and iterate; it's actually easier to create portraits before the covers are done in some cases
- The 30-portrait full cast price is deliberately set to make mid-range packs feel like excellent value — most authors will land on the 10-Pack or 15-Pack
- Frame character portraits as a reader engagement strategy, not just art: "Your readers will come back to your website between books just to browse the character gallery. It creates a fandom attachment point that a simple book listing page never will."
