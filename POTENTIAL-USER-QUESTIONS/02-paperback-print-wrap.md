# Question: "Can you design a full paperback or hardcover wrap — spine and back cover included?"

## Your Answer — Copy-Paste Ready Pitch

Absolutely. A full print wrap is the natural extension of any ebook cover design, and it's a service I offer both as an add-on to existing covers and as a standalone project.

Here's what a full print wrap involves and why it's more involved than people expect:

**The spine** is not simply a stripe of color between the front and back — it needs to be calculated precisely. Spine width depends on your page count, paper type (white or cream), and Amazon KDP Print's specific formula. I calculate this for you using your exact page count, so the spine text and any design elements land cleanly within the safe zone, with nothing bleeding into the front or back panels.

**The back cover** includes your book description (formatted for print, not Amazon HTML), any series branding or logo, an author bio block, and the barcode placement area. The barcode itself is either generated by the printer at upload or I can supply a placeholder in the correct position. Amazon KDP Print handles barcode placement automatically at upload, but I include a correctly positioned placeholder zone so the file is fully print-ready.

**The full wrap** is a single flat file that wraps the spine precisely between front and back, exported as a 300 DPI PDF with 0.125" bleed on all sides, CMYK color profile (for print accuracy), and exact trim dimensions — ready for upload to Amazon KDP Print with no further processing needed.

Everything I design is production-tested. My own published series include both ebook and print editions, and I've gone through the Amazon KDP Print upload process myself with my own published series. I know exactly where errors hide — color profile mismatches, spine text too close to the edge, fonts not embedded — and I prevent all of them before delivery.

If you already have an ebook cover designed by me, the print wrap is a straightforward extension and I can match the front panel exactly. If your ebook cover was designed by someone else, send me the file and I'll assess whether I can extend it or whether a rebuild is needed.

**Turnaround:** 2 business days for an add-on to an existing cover. 3–4 business days for a new design.

**What I need from you:** Page count, paper type (cream or white), your Amazon-assigned ISBN or your own, back cover copy (your description + author bio), and your existing front cover file if applicable.

> **Note on hardcover:** Hardcover case wrap dimensions differ slightly from paperback. Amazon KDP Print supports hardcover publishing — if you're publishing hardcover, let me know up front so I use the correct file specifications.

## Notes for You (Internal Use)

- This is a natural upsell for any author who has already purchased a cover package — "Do you also want a print edition?" is an easy conversation to have
- Spine width formula: KDP uses (page count × 0.002252") + 0.06" for white paper; 0.0025" per page for cream. Always double-check with their current cover calculator tool
- Amazon KDP Print adds the barcode automatically at upload — include a placeholder zone in the correct position (2" × 1.2" in the bottom-right corner of the back panel) so the client knows where it will land
- Most authors don't realize the full wrap is a completely different file from the ebook cover — they assume it's a simple export. Use this as an education opportunity to justify the price
- If the author's existing ebook cover has gradients or dark backgrounds, the print version may need color adjustments for CMYK accuracy — flag this upfront
