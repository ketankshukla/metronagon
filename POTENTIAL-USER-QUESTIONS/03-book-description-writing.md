# Question: "Can you write my Amazon book description / back cover blurb?"

## Your Answer — Copy-Paste Ready Pitch

Yes — and this is actually one of the most underestimated parts of publishing. A cover gets a reader to click. The description is what converts that click into a sale. Most authors write their own descriptions and leave significant sales on the table because they're too close to their own work to write about it the way a reader needs to hear it.

Here's what I do differently from a generic copywriter:

I'm a published author with 22 books across three series — I've written Amazon descriptions for every single one of them. I know what a fantasy description needs to feel like versus a non-fiction description. I know the difference between a hook that reads like marketing and a hook that reads like the beginning of a story. I know how to write the kind of description that makes a reader think "I need to know what happens" rather than "this sounds like a book I might read someday."

**What a professional Amazon description includes:**

The **hook** — the first 1–2 sentences that appear in search results before "Read more." This is the only thing most potential buyers see. It has to do the entire job in 20 words or fewer.

The **story tension** — a 100–150 word section that builds the stakes, establishes the protagonist and their problem, and ends on an unresolved question. Not a plot summary. A promise.

The **proof line** — a sentence that anchors the reader in the genre and signals what kind of experience they're buying. Comp titles, mood descriptors, and series positioning all belong here.

The **series hook** (for series books) — a closing line that either entices the reader to continue to book 2, or (for later books) reminds them of the momentum already built.

**For non-fiction:** The structure is different but equally disciplined — I lead with the reader's problem, promise the transformation, list the core insights or methods without giving away the content, and close with a credibility signal and urgency line.

I've done this for philosophy, self-help, and fantasy. If you send me your manuscript or a thorough synopsis, I'll write a description that does its job.

Turnaround is 1 business day per book.

> **Note on series pricing:** Each book in a series needs a different description — but they must also feel like they belong together, with consistent voice and escalating stakes. Series pack pricing accounts for the additional work of writing them as a unified body of copy, not independent pieces.

## What I Need From You

To write your description, I need one of the following:
- Your completed manuscript (I'll read what I need to)
- A detailed synopsis (3–5 paragraphs) covering plot, protagonist, central conflict, and resolution direction
- For non-fiction: your chapter list and a description of the transformation you promise the reader

The more context you give me, the better the result. A two-sentence brief produces a generic description. A thorough synopsis produces something that actually sells.

## Notes for You (Internal Use)

- This is a powerful upsell alongside any cover or pipeline package — authors who are getting covers designed are already thinking about their Amazon page
- The Pipeline packages already include book descriptions — don't double-sell this to Pipeline clients unless they want additional books described
- The A/B variant option is worth mentioning to any author who's data-driven or who has run Amazon ads — they'll immediately understand why having two versions to test is valuable
- Non-fiction descriptions are actually easier to write than fiction ones (the problem/solution structure is more formulaic) — price accordingly if the client has a simple self-help book
- If a client has an existing description they're unhappy with, offer a rewrite at the single-book rate — you're not writing from scratch but you're still doing the intellectual work
