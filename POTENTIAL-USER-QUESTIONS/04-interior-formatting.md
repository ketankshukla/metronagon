# Question: "Can you format the interior of my book for print or ebook?"

## Your Answer — Copy-Paste Ready Pitch

Yes — interior formatting is the invisible work that separates a professional book from a self-published one. Readers may not consciously notice great interior formatting, but they absolutely notice bad formatting: paragraphs that run into each other, inconsistent chapter headings, orphaned lines at the bottom of pages, margins that feel cramped, or chapter openings that start awkwardly mid-page.

I format book interiors for both digital (ebook) and print (paperback/hardcover via KDP Print and IngramSpark).

**Print Interior Formatting** involves:

- Setting trim size (5×8", 5.5×8.5", 6×9", or your chosen size)
- Establishing proper margins — inside margins wider than outside to account for spine binding, with correct gutter spacing based on page count
- Setting baseline grid for consistent line spacing throughout
- Designing chapter opening pages — heading style, chapter number treatment, drop cap or decorative element if desired
- Ensuring no widows or orphans (single words or lines stranded at top/bottom of pages)
- Front matter: title page, copyright page, dedication, table of contents
- Back matter: author bio page, "Also by this author" series listing, acknowledgments if applicable
- Exporting as a press-ready PDF (PDF/X-1a or PDF/X-4) with embedded fonts and correct color profile
- Verifying against KDP or IngramSpark's current specifications before delivery

**Ebook (EPUB) Formatting** involves:

- Clean EPUB file compatible with Kindle, Apple Books, Kobo, and all major retailers
- Correctly structured HTML underneath (headings as h1/h2, not styled paragraphs — this matters for screen readers and accessibility compliance)
- Table of contents that functions in the ereader's built-in navigation
- Proper metadata: title, author, language, ISBN if applicable
- Tested across multiple ereader apps before delivery

**What I need from you:** Your manuscript as a clean Word .docx or Google Doc. Tell me your target trim size, paper type (cream or white), and target retailer (KDP, IngramSpark, both, or ebook-only). If you have any typographic preferences — serif vs. sans-serif body font, ornamental chapter dividers, specific heading style — include those in your brief.

Turnaround is 3–5 business days for a standard 50,000–80,000 word manuscript.

## Notes for You (Internal Use)

- Interior formatting is a natural add-on for any author who has already purchased covers — they're getting the outside of the book done, and the inside is the logical next step
- Authors who are publishing on IngramSpark for the first time often don't know the difference between KDP specs and IngramSpark specs — this is a place to add genuine value through education, not just file delivery
- Ebook formatting is often undersold — many authors use KDP's automatic conversion from Word, which produces messy, inconsistent results. Explain what clean EPUB formatting actually means for reader experience
- Series formatting is a strong upsell: once you've set the template for book 1, books 2–5 are significantly faster — which is reflected in the bundle pricing but still represents good margin
- Common problem to watch for: authors who paste their Word document from Google Docs often have hidden formatting characters, smart quotes disabled, or inconsistent heading styles — always request a clean export before starting
