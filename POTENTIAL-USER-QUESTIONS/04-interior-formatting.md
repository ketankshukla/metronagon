# Question: "Can you format the interior of my book for print or ebook?"

## Your Answer — Copy-Paste Ready Pitch

Yes — interior formatting is the invisible work that separates a professional book from a self-published one. Readers may not consciously notice great interior formatting, but they absolutely notice bad formatting: paragraphs that run into each other, inconsistent chapter headings, orphaned lines at the bottom of pages, margins that feel cramped, or chapter openings that start awkwardly mid-page.

I format book interiors for both Amazon Kindle (ebook) and Amazon KDP Print (paperback and hardcover).

**Print Interior Formatting** involves:

- Setting trim size (5×8", 5.5×8.5", 6×9", or your chosen size)
- Establishing proper margins — inside margins wider than outside to account for spine binding, with correct gutter spacing based on page count
- Setting baseline grid for consistent line spacing throughout
- Designing chapter opening pages — heading style, chapter number treatment, drop cap or decorative element if desired
- Ensuring no widows or orphans (single words or lines stranded at top/bottom of pages)
- Front matter: title page, copyright page, dedication, table of contents
- Back matter: author bio page, "Also by this author" series listing, acknowledgments if applicable
- Exporting as a press-ready PDF (PDF/X-1a or PDF/X-4) with embedded fonts and correct color profile
- Verifying against Amazon KDP Print's current specifications before delivery

**Kindle Ebook Formatting** involves:

- Clean Kindle-compatible file formatted to Amazon's specifications for Kindle devices and the Kindle app
- Correctly structured HTML underneath (headings as h1/h2, not styled paragraphs — this ensures correct rendering across all Kindle devices and the Kindle app on phones and tablets)
- Functioning table of contents for Kindle's built-in navigation panel
- Proper metadata: title, author, language, ASIN/ISBN if applicable
- Tested in Amazon's Kindle Previewer tool before delivery

**What I need from you:** Your manuscript as a clean Word .docx or Google Doc. Tell me your target format (Kindle ebook, KDP Print paperback, KDP Print hardcover, or all three), your trim size preference, and paper type (cream or white). If you have any typographic preferences — serif vs. sans-serif body font, ornamental chapter dividers, specific heading style — include those in your brief.

Turnaround is 3–5 business days for a standard 50,000–80,000 word manuscript.

## Notes for You (Internal Use)

- Interior formatting is a natural add-on for any author who has already purchased covers — they're getting the outside of the book done, and the inside is the logical next step
- Authors publishing on KDP Print for the first time often don't realize there are specific trim size, margin, and bleed requirements — explaining this positions you as an expert, not just a file-delivery service
- Kindle formatting is often undersold — many authors use KDP's automatic Word conversion, which produces inconsistent rendering across devices. Explain what properly structured Kindle formatting actually means for reader experience
- Series formatting is a strong upsell: once you've set the template for book 1, books 2–5 are significantly faster — which is reflected in the bundle pricing but still represents good margin
- Common problem to watch for: authors who paste their Word document from Google Docs often have hidden formatting characters, smart quotes disabled, or inconsistent heading styles — always request a clean export before starting
