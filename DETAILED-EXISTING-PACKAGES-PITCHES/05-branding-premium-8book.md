## The Pitch — Copy-Paste Ready

An 8-book series is an epic undertaking. The visual identity that carries it needs to be equally ambitious — built to sustain reader recognition across years of publication, consistent enough to function as a brand, and comprehensive enough that every marketing surface, every format, every platform looks like it belongs to the same world.

The Branding Premium package is the full treatment. Everything required to establish, document, and execute a complete visual identity for an 8+ book series — and to keep that identity intact as the series grows.

**Here's what you receive:**

**A premium series logo** — logomark and wordmark built with the scale of an epic series in mind. This logo will appear across 8, 10, or 12 books. It needs to feel weightier than a 3-book series logo. It needs to carry authority. It's designed specifically for the scope and genre of your series.

**All ebook covers — every book in the series.** Whether you're writing 8 books or 12, every cover is built from the same style guide. The same lighting direction. The same typographic hierarchy. The same color palette — calibrated so that even as individual book color palettes shift slightly to reflect each book's tone, the series as a whole remains visually unified. Book 1 and Book 12 look like they belong together.

**A box set cover** — landscape format, designed for Amazon bundle listings and marketing materials.

**A panoramic cover** — a wide-format scene that connects the major visual elements of your series into a single cinematic image. This is the image that works as a website hero banner, a convention display backdrop, a Facebook ad background, and a print poster. It's the visual expression of the entire series in one frame — and there's no other design asset that creates that kind of impact.

**A YouTube/social media thumbnail at 1280×720** — branded and consistent with the series visual language.

**An author portrait in series style** — your professional photo rendered or retouched to align with the visual aesthetic of your covers. Used on author pages, social profiles, book back matter, and press materials. When every visual element — including you — matches the series visual identity, the brand effect is complete.

**A comprehensive style guide** — the most thorough document in the Metronagon suite. This covers every visual decision made across the entire project: exact hex codes, font files and licensing, composition rules, character description guidelines for future cover briefs, expansion guidelines for books beyond the current count, and usage rules for derivative marketing materials. If you hand this to a different designer in 3 years and ask them to produce Book 11, it should be possible for them to follow the guide and produce something consistent.

**Why this price for this scope:**

An 8-book Premium package at $800 works out to $100 per book — which is less than the Standard single-cover price. That math is not accidental. At this scale, the system is the value. The style guide, the logo, the panoramic, the author portrait — these are one-time investments that serve the entire series. You're not paying for 8 individual covers. You're building infrastructure.

I've done this at 12-book scale with the Aztec Samurai Adventures series — complete branding, 12 covers, series logo, box set covers, panoramic, character portraits. That series has a visual identity strong enough to anchor a 30-character website with full character modals, a complete world-building gallery, and a brand that readers recognize on sight.

**Price: $800. 7 business days. A complete, documented visual identity for your epic-scale series.**

## When to Recommend This Package

- Author writing an epic-scale series (8, 10, or 12 books) — this is the only package built for this scope
- Fantasy, sci-fi, or long-form historical fiction where visual world-building is part of the genre contract
- Authors who intend to run Amazon ads, use Facebook/Instagram paid promotion, or do any paid advertising — the panoramic and thumbnail make ad creative production vastly easier
- Authors who want to build a dedicated series website (the panoramic cover becomes the hero image)

## What to Emphasize in the Pitch

- The per-book cost at this scale is exceptional value — make this math explicit
- The panoramic cover is unique to this package — no other tier includes it, and it's genuinely one of the most impactful single design assets a series can have
- The comprehensive style guide is what makes the entire series sustainable long-term — emphasize the "future-proof" angle for authors writing long series that will take years to complete
