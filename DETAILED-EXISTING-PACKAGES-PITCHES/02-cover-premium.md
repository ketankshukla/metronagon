## The Pitch — Copy-Paste Ready

Your book deserves a cover that stops a scroll. Not just a good cover — the best version of what your story can look like from the outside. That's what the Premium Cover package delivers.

The difference between Standard and Premium isn't just two extra revision rounds. It's the level of creative commitment applied to every decision. The Premium package uses the same visual pipeline that produced covers for all 22 of my published books — the same cinematic approach, the same advanced post-processing, the same meticulous attention to typography that makes the difference between a cover that looks like a real published book and one that looks like it was almost there.

**What Premium means in practice:**

You receive **three concept variations** — but each one is built with a premium visual direction that goes deeper than the Standard process. More lighting nuance. More atmosphere. More deliberate compositional choices. You're not choosing between three good options; you're choosing between three genuinely excellent ones.

The winning concept then goes through **two dedicated revision rounds**. The first round handles major adjustments — color direction, compositional shifts, title font choices. The second round handles the fine polish — exact color values, letter spacing, shadow depth, the difference between the cover looking great and looking precisely right.

**Priority queue placement** means your project is scheduled first. If I have multiple projects running simultaneously, yours gets dedicated, uninterrupted attention rather than being worked on between other jobs.

Final delivery is at **1600×2400, 300 DPI** — the same professional specification, with more work invested in producing a result that earns that resolution.

**Who this package is for:**

Authors who know that the cover is the most important marketing asset for their book and won't compromise on it. Authors who have a specific vision they want realized at the highest level. Authors who are launching into a competitive genre where the cover needs to earn its place among traditionally published books. Authors who've already invested significantly in their manuscript — editing, proofreading, months of writing — and recognize that now is not the moment to cut corners on presentation.

A $175 investment in a cover that performs is worth more than a $99 cover that almost works. The difference is the difference between a reader clicking and a reader scrolling past.

I've designed the covers for the Aztec Samurai Adventures 12-book fantasy series, the Repetition: Mother of Mastery 5-book non-fiction series, and the Reality Without Belief 5-book philosophy series — all using this same premium process. The result is 22 published books with covers that hold up next to any traditionally published work in their categories.

**Price: $175. Delivery: 3 business days. Priority placement. Two revision rounds. The best version of your cover.**

## When to Recommend This Package

- Standalone novel or lead title in a new series — this is the one that needs to make a statement
- Competitive genres where cover quality is the deciding factor (epic fantasy, thriller, romance)
- Authors with a specific, complex creative vision that benefits from more iterative development
- Authors who have already had a poor experience with cheaper cover designers elsewhere
- Relaunching an existing book with a new cover — the stakes of getting it right are high

## When the Standard Package is Sufficient

- The author is testing a new pen name or genre with low financial risk
- Budget is genuinely a constraint and 2 revisions is actually more than they need
- The timeline requires the 2-day delivery vs. 3-day Premium window
