## The Pitch — Copy-Paste Ready

You're writing a saga. Not a series — a world. Eight books, ten books, twelve books of interconnected story, characters whose arcs span years of publication, a visual identity that needs to sustain reader recognition across a decade of releases, and an Amazon presence that needs to convert whether a reader discovers your series at Book 1 or Book 7.

The Full Pipeline Premium package was built for exactly this. It is the most comprehensive production package in the Metronagon suite, and it covers everything required to build, document, and execute an epic-scale series from the ground up.

**Here's the full scope of what you receive:**

**Full series architecture for 8+ books.** This is the most involved planning document in the entire pipeline. Multi-arc design — your 8+ books likely span more than one major narrative arc, and those arcs need to be plotted as intentionally as individual acts within a single book. Chapter outlines for every book. Escalation mapping: identifying exactly where stakes are raised, complications are added, and the series' central questions are progressively answered without premature resolution. Comprehensive cross-book continuity tracking that ensures established facts, character knowledge states, and world rules don't contradict across a dozen books.

Authors who skip this kind of planning at epic scale often discover they've written themselves into an impossible structural position by Book 5 or 6. Retroactive fixes are costly — in revision time, in reader trust, and in the narrative integrity of the work. This plan prevents that.

**Every ebook cover in the series.** Eight covers, ten covers, twelve covers — every book gets a cover built from the same style guide. The same typographic system. The same color grading treatment. The same compositional language. A reader who picks up Book 8 at a used bookstore and has never heard of the series can see immediately, from the cover design alone, that there are seven more books waiting for them.

**Complete branding package.** Series logo (premium logomark + wordmark), panoramic cover, YouTube/social thumbnail, author portrait, comprehensive style guide. Every marketing surface covered.

**The panoramic cover** — included exclusively in the Premium pipeline — is a wide-format scene that places the major visual elements of your series into a single cinematic image. Heroes and villains. Iconic locations. The central conflict, distilled into one frame. This image functions as a website hero banner, a convention display backdrop, a Facebook ad background, and a print poster. There is no single design asset that communicates the scope of an epic series more powerfully than a well-executed panoramic cover.

**The author portrait in series style** positions you within the visual world of your own series — used on your author page, social profiles, press materials, and book back matter. When every visual element, including you, matches the series identity, the brand is complete.

**Keyword-optimized Amazon descriptions for every book** — written as a coordinated body of copy. An 8-book series description suite is a substantial copywriting project: each book needs to work as a standalone entry point for a new reader while also serving as a continuation hook for existing readers. Every description contributes to the same conversion strategy. Book 1 earns the click. Book 4 earns the loyalty. Book 8 earns the legacy.

**A full series bible** — the document that makes an epic series professionally sustainable. World rules and their exceptions. The magic or technology system, fully codified. Geography, political structures, cultural details. A complete timeline of events from before Book 1 through the current story. All established canon, organized and cross-referenced. Character backstories and their pre-series histories. This is the reference document your future self thanks your current self for building.

**Full character tracking database** — for series with large named casts (which 8+ book sagas invariably have), this is the operational backbone of the series. Character descriptions (physical, personality, role), relationship maps, knowledge states (what does each character know at the end of each book?), power progressions, emotional arcs across all books. When you're writing Book 7 and need to confirm exactly when a supporting character first appears, what they knew at the end of Book 3, and how their relationship with the protagonist has evolved — this document has the answer.

**Two rounds of revisions** — across every deliverable. Every element of the package can be adjusted in two full revision cycles.

**The scope perspective:**

At $1,400 for 8+ books with full planning, branding, descriptions, a series bible, and character tracking, you are receiving a professional production package that would cost $3,000–$5,000 if purchased from separate specialists at market rates. The integration advantage — everything planned and produced as a unified whole — is worth additional multiples on top of that.

I built the Aztec Samurai Adventures series at 12-book scale: complete branding, 12 covers, series logo, character portraits (30 of them), complete world-building documentation, and a live series website at aztec.ketanshukla.com with a full 30-character interactive gallery. That project was built using this exact pipeline. The system works at this scale because it was designed for this scale.

**Price: $1,400. 10 business days. An epic-scale series, built from the ground up.**

## When to Recommend This Package

- The package for epic fantasy, long-form sci-fi, historical saga, or any series planned at 8+ volumes
- Authors who have started writing an epic series and feel the planning is getting out of control — the series architecture and series bible are specifically designed to bring order to large-scale projects
- Authors who intend to build a dedicated series website (the panoramic cover becomes the hero image; the character portraits become the character gallery)
- Authors running paid advertising at scale — the complete visual asset suite makes ad creative production simple

## What to Emphasize in the Pitch

- The series bible is unique to this package — mention it specifically for world-building authors who have complex lore to track
- The panoramic cover is the single most powerful visual asset in the entire Metronagon suite — it deserves its own moment in the pitch
- The per-book cost at this scale ($1,400 ÷ 12 books = $116/book for everything) is exceptional — make this math explicit
- Reference the Aztec Samurai Adventures site as a live, working example of what this pipeline produces
