## The Pitch — Copy-Paste Ready

Already working with Metronagon on an existing project? Updates and revisions to previous work are available as standalone purchases — so you don't need to repurchase a full package when you need a targeted change.

Every update is priced for exactly what it is: the focused work required to make a specific change, without charging for production work that doesn't need to be redone.

## Cover Updates

### Cover — Minor Revision
**$20 | 1 business day**

> Your cover is already built. You need a specific targeted change — a text correction, a subtitle update, a color shift, an author name format adjustment. This is that change. Send me the specific modification you need and your original file, and I'll deliver the updated cover the next business day. No redesign, no new concepts — just the change you need, done properly.

**Covers:** Text fixes, color adjustments, subtitle changes, author name corrections, font size tweaks, ISBN barcode updates

---

### Cover — Major Revision
**$50 | 2 business days**

> The cover concept needs to change significantly — different visual direction, different style, layout overhaul, new scene, different character focus. This is a substantive creative rebuild that goes beyond a targeted edit. You receive a new concept direction developed from your updated brief, refined to final polish and delivered at full resolution within 2 business days.

**Covers:** New concept direction, different artistic style, complete layout restructure, new scene composition

---

### Add New Book Cover (Matching Existing Series)
**$85 | 2 business days**

> You've added a book to your series and need its cover to match everything you've already published. This isn't a new design from scratch — it's a new cover built from your existing series style guide (or the visual language I established when I designed your original covers). The same fonts, the same color palette, the same compositional logic. Book N looks like it belongs next to Books 1 through N-1. Delivered in 2 business days.

**Best for:** Authors extending their series, adding a prequel or bonus novella, or publishing an additional volume in an existing visual family

---

## Branding Updates

### Logo Refresh
**$100 | 2 business days**

> Your series logo needs an update — refined proportions, updated wordmark, adapted for a new context (e.g., your logo looks great large but loses clarity at small sizes), or a full redesign while maintaining brand recognition. This covers a thoughtful, purposeful evolution of your existing visual identity rather than building a new one from scratch.

**Covers:** Proportion refinement, wordmark updates, scale optimization, color adjustments, full redesign maintaining brand continuity

---

### New Box Set Cover
**$75 | 2 business days**

> You need an additional box set or panoramic cover — for a new bundle configuration (e.g., you've added Books 4 and 5 and want an updated complete series cover), for a different format (portrait vs. landscape), or for a promotional campaign. Built from your existing style guide to match your current series visual identity.

**Covers:** Additional bundle configurations, alternative format covers, promotional campaign covers, updated series panoramics

---

## Plan & Story Updates

### Add Book to Plan
**$100 | 2 business days**

> Your series is growing. A new volume needs to be integrated into your existing series plan — that means a chapter outline for the new book, a continuity update (checking that everything established in previous books remains consistent), and an arc update integrating the new book's events into the series-wide timeline. Not just "here's a new outline" — a proper integration that treats your series as the interconnected structure it is.

**Covers:** New chapter outline, continuity integration, arc update, character knowledge state update for the new book

---

### Plan Restructure
**$175 | 3 business days**

> Your series plan needs significant reorganization — reordering books, splitting one book into two, merging two planned books into one, significantly changing the series arc. This is substantive structural work that requires re-examining continuity, arc balance, and cross-book dependencies across the entire series. Delivered as a revised version of your original plan document with all changes implemented and documented.

**Covers:** Book reordering, splits, merges, major arc revisions, series length changes

---

### Book Description Update
**$20 | 1 business day**

> Your book's Amazon description needs updating — a new tagline, a revised hook, updated comp title references, or a complete rewrite for a relaunching book. This is targeted copywriting work on a single description. Send me the current text, what you want changed, and any new positioning direction, and I'll deliver an updated description the next business day.

**Covers:** Hook revisions, complete rewrites, relaunches, updated positioning, adding formatted HTML structure

---

## Children's Book Updates

### Children's Book — Page Edit
**$25 per page | 1 day per page**

> A specific page in your existing picture book needs to change — new story text, adjusted illustration composition, different character expression, updated scene details. This covers the re-illustration of the page with the specified changes, delivered at the same resolution as the original files, and an updated assembled PDF with the revised page in place.

**Covers:** Story text changes requiring illustration update, character expression adjustments, scene composition changes, background updates

---

### Children's Book — Add Page
**$40 per page | 1 day per page**

> Your story needs a new page — an additional scene, an expanded narrative moment, a transitional page that wasn't in the original production. This covers story text development for the new page, a new full illustration in the existing book's style, and an updated assembled PDF with the new page integrated in the correct position.

**Covers:** Additional narrative pages, new scenes, expanded story sections, new illustrations matching existing book style

---

### Children's Book — New Character
**$50 | 2 business days**

> A new character needs to be introduced into your existing picture book — a friend, a sibling, a supporting figure, a talking animal. This covers the design of the new character to match your existing book's visual style, integration into any pages where they appear, and delivery of a character reference sheet for future use.

**Covers:** New secondary characters, supporting figures, animals, introducing new faces into the existing book's visual world

## Notes for You (Internal Use)

- Updates are for existing clients only — always verify they previously purchased a package before processing an update order
- The $20 Minor Revision and $20 Book Description Update are your highest-frequency repeating revenue items — existing clients return for these regularly
- The Add New Book Cover ($85) is one of the strongest recurring revenue items for series authors: every new book in the series generates a new order
- For Reedsy proposals on update work, remember to apply the ÷0.80 formula: $20 → quote $25, $50 → quote $63, $85 → quote $107, $100 → quote $125
- Children's book page edits can add up quickly — a client who asks to change "a few pages" often ends up with 5–10 page edits. Quote the per-page rate clearly upfront and confirm the total page count before starting
