## The Pitch — Copy-Paste Ready

Three books need to look like one series. That's not as simple as picking a color palette and applying it. It requires a system — a visual language built from the ground up that every cover draws from, so that when a reader sees Book 3, they know instantly it's part of the same world as Books 1 and 2.

That's exactly what the Branding Starter package builds for your 3-book series.

**Here's what you receive:**

**A custom series logo.** Not a title treatment — an actual logo, with a logomark and a wordmark designed to function at multiple scales. At favicon size. At hero banner size. Printed on a bookmark. It anchors your series identity everywhere it appears.

**Three ebook covers built from a shared style guide.** This is the critical distinction between branding and individual cover design: these three covers are designed together, as a family. They share the same color palette (defined to exact hex values, not eyeballed), the same typographic system (same fonts, same hierarchy, same size relationships), the same lighting direction (so characters on different covers feel like they're lit by the same sun), and the same compositional logic (similar focal point placement, similar text zone reservations). The result is a set of covers that looks like a series — not three books that coincidentally have similar fonts.

**A box set cover.** A landscape-format composite cover that shows all three books together as a single product, designed for Amazon box set listings. This is the image that appears when you bundle your series, and it needs to look as intentional as the individual covers. Box set covers are often afterthoughts. This one is built into the system from the start.

**A style guide document.** A PDF that documents every visual decision made during the design process: the exact hex codes for your series color palette, the fonts used (with licensing notes), the compositional rules for future covers, and guidance on how to expand the visual identity to marketing materials. If you add a Book 4 in 18 months, this document ensures it looks like it belongs.

**Everything in 3 business days.** This timeline is possible because the branding process is a system, not an improvisation. Every decision feeds the next one — the logo informs the typography, the typography informs the cover layout, the covers inform the box set. The speed is a product of the clarity of the process.

I've built this same system across three of my own published series — 22 books total — each with its own distinct visual identity that holds across every volume. The system works because it was designed to scale.

**Price: $275. Three books. One visual system. A series that looks like a series.**
