## The Pitch — Copy-Paste Ready

I want to put your book in front of readers looking for exactly what you've written. That starts with a cover that does its job in the half second a reader spends deciding whether to click.

Here's what the Standard Cover package delivers:

You'll receive **three fully realized concept variations** — not thumbnail sketches or mood boards, but three complete cover directions with professional typography, full composition, and color treatment. You look at all three side by side, pick the one that resonates, and tell me what you want adjusted. I refine the winning concept with one dedicated revision round — adjusting colors, font placement, subtitle positioning, or any compositional element — and deliver your final cover at **1600×2400 pixels, 300 DPI**, ready for immediate upload to Amazon KDP, IngramSpark, or any distribution platform.

The entire process takes **2 business days** from the moment you send me your brief.

**What "photorealistic or stylized" means in practice:**
- **Photorealistic** — cinematic, atmospheric covers that look like a major publisher produced them. Think: dramatic lighting, realistic character rendering, environment detail. Works exceptionally well for thriller, fantasy, historical fiction, and literary fiction.
- **Stylized** — illustrated or graphic design-forward covers that lean into art direction over realism. Works well for romance, cozy mystery, young adult, self-help, and non-fiction.

You tell me your genre, your story's emotional tone, and any visual references that excite you (book covers in your genre that you admire, mood images, color preferences). I handle everything from there.

**Why this cover will work at thumbnail size:**
Most authors think of their cover as something readers see on a full browser page. The reality is that on Amazon's search results, your cover appears as a 100-pixel-wide thumbnail. Composition, contrast, and typography all need to hold up at that scale. I design covers to work at thumbnail first — which is why our covers convert on Amazon rather than just looking nice in isolation.

I've designed covers for 22 published books across three complete series. Every one of those covers went through this same process. I'm not guessing at what works — I've tested it in the actual marketplace.

**Price: $99. Delivery: 2 business days. Let's get your book dressed properly.**
