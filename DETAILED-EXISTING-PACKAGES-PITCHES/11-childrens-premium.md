## The Pitch — Copy-Paste Ready

The Premium children's book package is for authors who want to produce a picture book that stands alongside the best in traditional publishing — technically flawless, visually exceptional, and built to be reproducible if you want to continue the character's story in future volumes.

The fundamental distinction of the Premium tier is the **custom character design system** — and understanding why this matters requires understanding what it costs when it's absent.

Character inconsistency is the most common failure point in self-published picture books. Not poor illustration quality — inconsistency. The main character has slightly different hair in chapter 4. Their eyes are a different shape on page 19. Their clothing shifts subtly between scenes. Children notice this immediately, even if they can't articulate it. Parents notice it too. It signals that the book was made quickly, without a professional production system.

The solution is a formal character design system built before a single story page is illustrated: front view, three-quarter view, side view, expression sheet (happy, sad, surprised, determined, afraid, excited), clothing detail sheet, and scale reference establishing the character's proportions relative to other figures. This system functions as the production bible for every illustration that follows. No character inconsistency because the reference is unambiguous. No guesswork. The same character, every page.

**Here's what the Premium package delivers:**

**Story writing or adaptation** — with the highest level of narrative refinement: enhanced structure, vocabulary precisely calibrated for the target age group (3–7, 4–8, or 6–10 — specified in your brief), pedagogical consideration if the book has an educational theme, and pacing designed for read-aloud performance.

**Custom character design system** — front view, side view, expression sheet, clothing detail, scale reference. All created and approved before page illustration begins. This is the document that guarantees character consistency.

**32 fully illustrated pages** at premium quality — multiple refinement passes per illustration. The highest visual standard in the Metronagon children's book suite.

**Print-ready formatting** to Amazon KDP Print specifications — bleed, margins, gutter, CMYK color profile, all page specifications exactly to Amazon's requirements.

**A complete assembled PDF** — full book in print order, cover to back cover.

**Individual page files** — all 32 illustrations plus cover art at high resolution.

**A story text document** — the complete story text, page-by-page, delivered as a separate document. This is your script. It can be used for audio narration, audiobook production, translation into other languages, accessibility adaptations (large-print versions), school curriculum use, or as the basis for an animated adaptation. It is yours, permanently. Every word, documented separately from the illustrated files.

**Two rounds of revisions** — two full passes across any or all elements: illustrations, story text, character design, layout, color treatment.

**When Premium is the right choice:**

You're building a character, not just a book. You plan to continue this character's story in future volumes — which means the character design system you build in this production becomes the template for the next book, and the one after. A first book produced with a formal character design system saves significant time and cost on every subsequent book, because the character is already documented.

Your story has cultural specificity that demands design accuracy. Indigenous characters, historical dress, non-Western physical features, cultural artifacts — these require intentional, referenced design work, not improvised illustration. The character design system is the correct tool for this.

You want the best possible result and won't accept the second-best version of your book. The Premium package is the one you choose when "good enough" is not the standard.

I built the Ixchel and the Stolen Sun picture book — a 32-page story featuring an Aztec girl protagonist — using this same system. Every page shows the same character, in the same cultural clothing, with the same face and proportions. That's not an accident; it's a production system. That system is available to you.

**Price: $1,000. 7 business days. The best version of your picture book, built to professional standards and ready for every format.**

## When to Recommend This Package

- Authors planning a series of picture books with a recurring character — the character design system makes every subsequent volume faster and cheaper to produce
- Authors with culturally specific characters where design accuracy is important
- Authors who want the story text delivered separately for audio narration, translation, or adaptation
- Authors who have already published a children's book and want to significantly raise the quality bar for their next one
- Authors giving the book as a significant gift (personalized picture books for grandchildren, legacy projects) where production quality is the entire point

## What to Emphasize in the Pitch

- The character design system is the primary differentiator — explain the inconsistency problem first, then explain why this system solves it
- The story text document is a genuine value add that most authors don't initially consider — raising the use cases (audio narration, translation, adaptation) often triggers an immediate "oh, I need that"
- The Premium package is the correct choice whenever the author's character has cultural or design specificity that demands careful, referenced illustration work
