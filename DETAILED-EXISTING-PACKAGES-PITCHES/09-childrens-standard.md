## The Pitch — Copy-Paste Ready

A children's picture book sounds simple. It's 32 pages. Short sentences. Bright pictures. How hard can it be?

The answer is: significantly harder than any other type of book to produce at a professional level. Here's why.

In a novel, the author controls every detail through words. In a picture book, the author controls approximately 40% of the story — the text. The illustrations carry the other 60%. Every emotion the child feels, every moment of wonder, every laugh — these happen visually. If the illustrations are inconsistent, rushed, or technically weak, the book fails, regardless of how good the writing is.

The hardest technical problem in illustrated picture book production is **character consistency** — keeping the main character looking like the same person on every one of 32 pages, across 32 completely different scenes, with different backgrounds, different lighting, different actions, and different companions. This is the problem that separates professional illustration from amateur illustration. I solved it for my own published picture book, Ixchel and the Stolen Sun, and the system I built to solve it is the same one I use for every client.

**Here's what the Standard package delivers:**

**Story writing or adaptation.** If you have a concept — a character, a theme, a lesson you want the book to convey — I develop it into a complete, age-appropriate picture book story with proper pacing, language calibrated for 3–7 year olds, and the specific structure that works in a 32-page format (where you have approximately 14 double-page spreads to tell the full story). If you already have a written story, I adapt it to fit the format.

**32 fully illustrated pages.** Every page receives a complete, full-color illustration in a Pixar/Disney-inspired aesthetic (or your preferred style direction). Not a placeholder. Not a rough sketch with color fills. A finished illustration. Each one.

**Consistent character design.** The main character maintains the same face, proportions, hair, and clothing on page 1 and page 32. This is achieved through a visual anchoring system — key reference images established at the start of production that every subsequent illustration is checked against. This is how professional animation studios maintain character consistency and it's the method I use.

**An assembled PDF.** All 32 pages, front cover, and back cover assembled in the correct order into a single PDF — ready for digital distribution, Kindle Kids, or print submission.

**Individual page image files.** All 32 illustrations delivered as separate high-resolution files — useful for marketing materials, social media posts, and alternative layouts.

**One round of revisions** — adjustments to any pages that need refinement: character expressions, scene composition, text placement, color adjustments.

**Delivered in 5 business days.** Production runs in a structured sequence: story development first, then character anchoring, then pages in order. The system is efficient precisely because it's planned.

I've done this from start to finish with a complete published picture book. If you have a story in your head and want to see it on a page — professionally, completely, properly — this is the package that makes that happen.

**Price: $500. 5 business days. A complete 32-page illustrated picture book, from concept to delivery.**
