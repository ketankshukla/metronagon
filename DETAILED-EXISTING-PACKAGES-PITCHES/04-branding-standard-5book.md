## The Pitch — Copy-Paste Ready

A 5-book series is not five individual books. It's a world. A brand. A commitment a reader makes when they buy Book 1 because they believe the series will deliver on its visual and narrative promise for every volume that follows.

The Branding Standard package builds the complete visual identity for that world — not just five covers, but a unified system that governs how your series looks everywhere it appears.

**Here's exactly what you receive:**

**A custom series logo** — logomark and wordmark designed to anchor your visual identity across every touchpoint. It appears on your covers, your website, your social media, your author newsletter. When a reader has seen your logo three times, they recognize it. That recognition builds a following.

**Five ebook covers from a single style guide.** The distinction matters: these five covers are not designed one after another with loose visual similarities. They're designed as a family, from a style guide built before the first cover is started. Every typographic decision, every color value, every compositional rule is documented and applied consistently across all five. The result is a series that looks like it was published by the same creative team across every volume — because it was.

**A box set cover** for your Amazon bundle listing — a landscape composite that shows the full 5-book series as a single premium product. This is what readers see when they decide to buy everything at once rather than just Book 1. It needs to inspire that decision. This one does.

**A YouTube/social media thumbnail at 1280×720** — built from the series' visual language. This is the image that appears on your book trailer, your author channel, your Facebook ad, your newsletter header. Every marketing surface you touch gets a piece of visual real estate that's consistent with your covers.

**A comprehensive style guide PDF** documenting every decision made in the design process: exact hex codes, font files and licensing notes, composition rules, text zone specifications, expansion guidelines for future covers or marketing materials. Your visual identity is documented, portable, and future-proof.

**Why five books?**

Because a 5-book series is where series branding starts to pay its full dividend. With three books, a consistent look is professional. With five books, it becomes a brand. When a reader finishes Book 5 and tells a friend about the series, the friend can identify all five books immediately on Amazon by look alone. That recognition — that brand equity — is worth multiples of the design cost.

I built this exact system for the Repetition: Mother of Mastery series (5 books), the Reality Without Belief series (5 books), and then extended it to the Aztec Samurai Adventures (12 books). Each series has its own completely distinct visual identity — different color palettes, different typographic personalities, different compositional approaches — but each one is internally consistent across every volume.

**Price: $475. 5 business days. A complete visual identity for your 5-book series, built to last.**

## When to Recommend This Package

- Author with a complete or planned 5-book series (the most common series length in indie publishing)
- Author who also produces YouTube or social media content and needs branded visual assets
- Author in a highly competitive genre (epic fantasy, thriller, romance) where series brand recognition drives re-purchases
- Rebranding an existing 5-book series that has inconsistent or outdated covers

## When to Upsell to Premium (8+ Books) Instead

- The series is planned for 6 or more books — better to build the 8+ system now than to extend later
- The author wants a panoramic cover (included in Premium, not Standard)
- The author wants an author portrait in series style (included in Premium)
- The author explicitly asks about a comprehensive visual brand document — the Premium style guide is notably more thorough
