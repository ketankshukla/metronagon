## The Pitch — Copy-Paste Ready

A 5-book series is the most common format in serious indie publishing — long enough to build a readership, complete enough to feel like a world, ambitious enough that production quality matters enormously. The Full Pipeline Standard package delivers everything you need to produce, brand, and position a 5-book series at a professional level.

Not just the covers. Not just the plan. Everything — designed together, from the same strategy, in a single production window.

**Here's exactly what you receive:**

**A full series plan for all 5 books.** This is not a vague outline — it's a working architectural document. Multi-book arc with escalating stakes across the entire series. Mid-series pivot point identified and planned (the structural turn that happens around Book 3 that separates great series from series that run out of steam). Individual chapter outlines for every book. Full cross-book continuity mapping: character knowledge states, subplot threads, world facts established in Book 1 that pay off in Book 5, seeds planted early that bloom late.

When authors skip this kind of upfront planning, they write themselves into corners by Book 3. They retcon things from Book 1. They over-explain in Book 4 because they under-seeded in Book 2. This plan prevents all of that.

**Five ebook covers from a unified style guide.** The same system as the Branding Standard package — consistent color palette, typography, lighting, and composition across all five. A series that looks like a series. Not five books with similar fonts.

**Full series branding.** Series logo (logomark + wordmark), comprehensive style guide PDF, visual identity system built to expand as the series grows. Everything documented.

**Box set cover + YouTube/social thumbnail.** Landscape box set composite for Amazon bundling. 1280×720 branded thumbnail for your book trailer, YouTube channel, Facebook ads, or social media. Your visual identity extends beyond the covers into every marketing surface.

**Five keyword-optimized Amazon descriptions.** Written as a progressive set. Book 1's description is a series entry point — it needs to make someone who's never heard of you curious enough to take a chance. Book 3's description assumes they've read Books 1 and 2 and need to feel the stakes escalating. Book 5's description has to pay off four books of investment while still being compelling to a new reader who discovers the series late. Writing these as a coordinated body of copy — rather than five independent pieces — is the difference between a series that reads professionally and one that reads like it was assembled from parts.

**Continuity plan.** A formal tracking document: character database, subplot register, callback registry, thematic throughline documentation. Everything you establish in Book 1 through Book 5 is tracked, cross-referenced, and accessible when you're writing Book 4 and need to remember what you said about a specific character in Chapter 7 of Book 2.

**Two rounds of revisions** on everything. Two full passes across any or all deliverables — plans, covers, logo, descriptions, continuity documents.

**The value in context:**

Buying these components individually at standard rates: Series plan + 5 covers + branding + descriptions would total approximately $875 or more. The Pipeline Standard delivers all of it for $800, bundled with the integration advantage — everything was designed to work together because it was planned together.

I did this for my own 5-book Repetition: Mother of Mastery series and my 5-book Reality Without Belief series. Every book in both series was planned before writing, covered under a single style guide, and described using a progressive copy strategy. Both series have published, visually consistent, Amazon-listed presences that hold up against any traditionally published competition.

**Price: $800. 7 business days. Your complete 5-book series — planned, branded, and ready to publish.**

## When to Recommend This Package

- This is the flagship package — recommend it as the default for any author planning a 5-book series
- Authors who are writing their first serious series and want the best structural foundation available
- Authors who have tried to plan a series on their own and gotten tangled in continuity issues — the series plan component specifically solves this
- Authors planning to run Amazon ads — the Amazon descriptions and branded visual assets are the core of any ad campaign

## When to Upsell to Premium Pipeline (8+ Books)

- The author is planning a saga, not a series — 6+ books is the natural territory for the Premium pipeline
- The author explicitly asks about a series bible or world-building documentation (included in Premium, not Standard)
- The author's series includes a large cast of named characters that need formal tracking (the Premium character tracking document handles this)
- The author wants a panoramic cover (unique to the Premium pipeline)
