## The Pitch — Copy-Paste Ready

Most authors approach a series book by book — they write Book 1, publish it, then figure out Book 2 when they get there. This approach creates inconsistency: covers that don't quite match, plot threads that weren't set up properly, descriptions that don't build on each other, a series that reads and looks like it was made up as it went along.

The Full Pipeline Starter package solves this from the beginning. Before a single cover is designed or a single description is written, your entire 3-book series is planned as a unified whole.

**Here's what you receive across all five components:**

**Series plan for all 3 books.** A complete series architecture: the overarching arc for the full trilogy, individual chapter outlines for every book, and a cross-book continuity plan that tracks character knowledge states, subplot threads, and established world facts across all three volumes. You write from a plan that was designed for three books — not a plan that was extended from one. The difference in structural quality is significant.

**Three ebook covers from a shared style guide.** Designed together, not sequentially. Every cover shares the same typographic system, color palette, lighting direction, and compositional logic. The series looks like a series from day one.

**A custom series logo.** Logomark and wordmark that anchors the visual identity across all marketing materials and future expansion.

**A box set cover.** Landscape composite for Amazon bundle listings — designed to showcase your trilogy as a premium collected edition.

**Keyword-optimized Amazon descriptions for all 3 books.** This is where the Pipeline differentiates from the Branding package: the descriptions are written as a set, not individually. Book 1's description positions the series and creates urgency to continue. Book 2's description assumes familiarity with Book 1 and escalates the stakes. Book 3's description pays off the series promise while remaining compelling to a new reader who discovers the trilogy at the end. They read as a body of copy — not three standalone pieces.

**One round of revisions** covering any deliverable — plan structure, covers, logo, descriptions. Everything can be adjusted in a single revision cycle.

**The value calculation:**

The Branding Starter (3 books) costs $1,400 and covers logo + covers + box set. The Pipeline Starter adds book descriptions for $1,800 — that's $400 for the descriptions, which at standard per-book rates would cost $600 on their own. You're saving $200 by bundling.

I built this pipeline for my own three series — the Aztec Samurai Adventures, Repetition: Mother of Mastery, and Reality Without Belief. Every book in those series was published from a pre-planned series architecture, with descriptions written to work together as a set. That planning shows in the finished product.

**Price: $425. 5 business days. Your trilogy, planned and presented — before you write a single word or buy a single cover.**

## When to Recommend This Package

- Author starting a new trilogy who hasn't yet planned the full arc
- Author who has written Book 1 but hasn't planned Books 2 and 3 — the series plan will help them avoid structural problems in the remaining books
- Author who wants covers AND descriptions together — the bundled pricing makes this significantly better value than buying each separately
- Author who is preparing to launch all three books simultaneously or in rapid succession

## When to Upsell to Standard Pipeline (5 Books)

- The series is planned to be longer than 3 books — 5 is the most common natural series length
- The author is running a social media presence and wants the YouTube thumbnail included (only in 5-book Pipeline and up)
- The author mentions wanting a "series bible" or "continuity tracker" — the 5-book pipeline includes a formal continuity plan document; the 3-book plan is more lightweight
