## The Pitch — Copy-Paste Ready

You want to hold your book. You want to see it on a shelf, hand it to a child, watch them carry it around until the spine starts to loosen. That means print — and print means the Plus package.

The Children's Book Plus package delivers everything in the Standard package, elevated to print-ready quality and formatted to the exact specifications required by IngramSpark and Amazon KDP Print. When the files leave my studio, they're ready to upload directly to your chosen printer with no additional processing required.

**Here's what Plus adds over Standard:**

**Enhanced illustration quality.** Every illustration receives additional refinement passes — more attention to background depth, lighting consistency across pages, and detail in secondary characters and environments. The Standard package produces professional illustrations. The Plus package produces illustrations you'd frame.

**Print-ready formatting.** This is the core distinction of the Plus tier. A children's picture book designed for print requires: precise bleed on all sides (so color extends fully to the trimmed edge with no white borders), correct gutter margins (accounting for the binding that pulls the inner edges inward), color profile conversion to CMYK-safe values (so what you see on screen is what comes off the press), and page dimensions matched to the exact trim size your printer requires. I format all of this to IngramSpark and KDP Print specifications. You receive a single print-ready PDF that uploads without issue.

**Complete assembled PDF.** Not just the 32 story pages — the full book in print order: front cover (with back cover and spine if applicable), front matter (title page, copyright page, dedication), all 32 story pages, and back matter. The PDF a printer receives is exactly the book.

**Individual page files.** All illustrations delivered separately at print resolution — useful for marketing materials, ARC distribution, or digital editions on secondary platforms.

**Two rounds of revisions.** An extra revision round over Standard — because print is permanent. You want to be certain before you commit to a print run. The second revision cycle exists specifically to give you that certainty.

**Why print matters for children's books specifically:**

Children's picture books are one of the few categories where print outsells digital by a significant margin. Children's ebooks exist, but the picture book experience is fundamentally physical — the weight of the book, the page turn, the shared lap reading. Authors who publish children's books digitally only are leaving the majority of their potential readership on the table.

The Plus package is also the foundation for any author considering a small print run for gifts, local bookstore placement, school visits, or author event sales. You don't need to commit to thousands of copies — IngramSpark's print-on-demand means a single copy can be ordered at a time, or a 50-copy order for an event, at reasonable per-unit cost. The Plus package gives you the files to make that possible.

I have a completed, print-formatted children's picture book — Ixchel and the Stolen Sun — that went through this exact production process. The print files exist, the character consistency was achieved, and the finished book is exactly what was planned. That's the track record behind this package.

**Price: $750. 6 business days. A complete 32-page illustrated picture book, print-ready and built to last.**

## When to Recommend This Package

- Any author who wants to sell physical copies — this is the default recommendation for children's books
- Authors doing school visits, author events, or local bookstore placement (all require physical copies)
- Gift books and family legacy projects where a printed copy is the whole point
- Authors submitting to IngramSpark or KDP Print for the first time — the print-ready files take the guesswork out of the upload process

## When to Upsell to Premium

- The author wants a dedicated **character design system** — reference sheets documenting the character from multiple angles and expressions, built before illustration begins. This is included in Premium, not Plus.
- The author's character has significant design complexity (intricate cultural clothing, armor, non-human features) that benefits from a formal design system
- The author mentions wanting the story text as a separate document (for translation, audiobook narration, or adaptation) — included in Premium
- The author is building a series of picture books and needs the character to be reproducible across multiple volumes
