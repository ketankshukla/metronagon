## 14. Thumbnail Strategy

For every video, create a thumbnail (1280 × 720 px) with:

1. **Dark background** with gold accent lighting
2. **The book cover(s)** featured prominently, angled with a slight 3D perspective
3. **Large bold text** — 3–5 words maximum (e.g., "12-BOOK SERIES", "DARK FANTASY COVER", "$75 COVER DESIGN")
4. **Your face** (optional but boosts CTR by 30%+) — reaction shot or pointing at the cover
5. **Gold border or accent line** at bottom or side — consistent brand element

Thumbnail text font: **Montserrat Black** or **Bebas Neue** in white with a dark drop shadow, gold accent on one keyword.
