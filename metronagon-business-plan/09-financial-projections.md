# Financial Projections

## Revenue Model

Metronagon Media generates revenue exclusively through one-time project payments. There are no subscriptions, retainers, or recurring billing. Every dollar of revenue comes from a client selecting a package, paying via Stripe, and receiving deliverables.

| **Profit margin**        | **~90–93%**         |

## Year 2 Projections (Summary)

With established reviews, raised prices, and a returning client base:

| Scenario     | Projected Annual Revenue | Projected Net Profit |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Conservative | $50,000–$65,000          | $44,000–$58,000      |
| Moderate     | $75,000–$100,000         | $67,000–$90,000      |
| Optimistic   | $110,000–$150,000        | $98,000–$135,000     |

Year 2 projections assume:

- Prices raised 30–50% across all packages
- Returning client rate of 20–30%
- 15–25 five-star reviews providing strong social proof
- Content marketing (blog + social) driving organic traffic
- Reedsy marketplace generating supplemental leads

## Break-Even Analysis

Given the minimal cost structure, break-even is achieved almost immediately:

| Monthly Fixed Costs             | ~$100                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Average order value             | ~$1,400               |
| Variable cost per order         | ~$15 (Stripe + tools) |
| **Orders needed to break even** | **1 order per month** |

The business is profitable from its first sale.

## Revenue Mix Forecast

Expected distribution of revenue across service categories (Year 1):

| Category            | % of Revenue | Rationale                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Series Branding     | 30–35%       | Highest volume — series authors are the core audience |
| Full Pipeline       | 25–30%       | Best value proposition drives larger orders           |
| Front Cover Design  | 15–20%       | Entry-level product, often leads to branding upsell   |
| Children's Books    | 10–15%       | Niche but high-value when it hits                     |
| Updates & Revisions | 5–10%        | Grows as client base accumulates                      |

## Cash Flow Characteristics

- **Payment timing:** Immediate — Stripe processes payment before work begins
- **Delivery timing:** 1–4 business days after payment
- **Cash flow cycle:** Positive — revenue is collected before costs are incurred
- **No accounts receivable:** All payments are prepaid via Stripe
- **No inventory:** Digital products with zero cost of goods sold
- **Seasonal variation:** Minimal expected — indie authors publish year-round, with potential spikes around Q4 (holiday book launches) and January (New Year resolution publishing)
