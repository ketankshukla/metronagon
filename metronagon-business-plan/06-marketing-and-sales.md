# Marketing & Sales Strategy

## Marketing Philosophy

Metronagon Media's marketing strategy is built on a simple premise: **let the work speak first, then amplify it through the right channels.** The founder's 22-book portfolio, 5 live websites, and 100+ cover examples constitute a marketing asset that most new creative businesses cannot match. The strategy focuses on making this portfolio visible to the right audience — indie authors actively seeking book cover design services.

## Sales Model

Metronagon operates a **self-service e-commerce model**. There is no sales team, no cold outreach, and no proposal process. The entire sales funnel is:

1. **Discovery** — Author finds Metronagon through search, social media, Reedsy, or referral
2. **Evaluation** — Author browses the website: examples page (100+ covers), case studies (3 complete series), services page (packages & pricing)
3. **Decision** — Author selects a package and clicks "Get Started"
4. **Purchase** — Secure Stripe embedded checkout — no account creation required
5. **Onboarding** — Thank-you page presents a customized requirements questionnaire based on the purchased package
6. **Delivery** — Files delivered via Google Drive or ZIP within 1–4 business days

The entire process — from discovery to paid order — can happen in a single session without any human interaction. This is by design: indie authors are accustomed to self-service purchasing and prefer clear pricing over negotiation.

## Marketing Channels

### 2. Social Media Presence

Active profiles established on platforms where indie authors congregate:

- **Facebook** — [facebook.com/metronagon](https://www.facebook.com/metronagon/) — Engage in indie author groups, share portfolio work
- **YouTube** — [@metronagon](https://www.youtube.com/@metronagon) — Potential for cover design process videos, time-lapses, and publishing tutorials
- **TikTok** — [@metronagon](https://www.tiktok.com/@metronagon) — Short-form cover reveal content, "BookTok" community engagement

**Content strategy:**

- Before/after cover transformations
- "Cover of the day" showcasing portfolio pieces
- Genre-specific cover design breakdowns
- Behind-the-scenes creative process
- Publishing tips from a 22-book author's perspective
- Client cover reveals (once client work begins)

### 3. Reedsy Marketplace

[Reedsy](https://reedsy.com/ketan-shukla) is the premier curated marketplace for book professionals. Having a profile on Reedsy provides:

- Access to authors actively searching for cover designers
- A review system that builds credibility over time
- Association with a trusted platform that vets its professionals
- Organic discovery by authors browsing the marketplace

**Strategy:** Use Reedsy as a secondary discovery channel. Direct Reedsy inquiries to the metronagon.com website for checkout. Accumulate Reedsy reviews to build marketplace credibility.

### 4. Portfolio Websites as Marketing Assets

Metronagon's five live websites serve as an always-on marketing portfolio:

| Website | URL | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metronagon Media | metronagon.com | Business website — services, examples, checkout |
| Author Portfolio | ketanshukla.com | Personal author site — all 22 books showcased |
| Aztec Samurai Adventures | aztec.ketanshukla.com | 12-book fantasy series showcase |
| Repetition: Mother of Mastery | repetition.ketanshukla.com | 5-book non-fiction series showcase |
| Reality Without Belief | reality.ketanshukla.com | 5-book philosophy series showcase |

Each website demonstrates the full scope of Metronagon's capabilities — cover design, series branding, logo design, box set covers, and web development — in a live, verifiable context. Any potential client can browse these sites and then verify the books exist on Amazon.

### 5. Amazon Author Presence

All 22 books are live on Amazon with direct purchase links. Each book listing serves as proof of work:

- **3 Amazon series pages** — complete with series-level branding
- **22 individual book listings** — each with professionally designed covers
- **Kindle + Paperback** — demonstrating competence across both formats
- **Amazon author page** — linking to all published works

### 6. Content Marketing (Blog)

The metronagon.com blog section is positioned for long-form content targeting indie authors:

**Planned content topics:**

- "How to Choose the Right Book Cover Style for Your Genre"
- "Series Branding 101: Why Consistency Sells"
- "What Makes a Good Amazon KDP Cover? Specifications and Best Practices"
- "Children's Book Illustration: What to Expect When Working with a Designer"
- "The Business of Book Covers: Pricing, Value, and What You're Actually Paying For"
- "From Author to Designer: How Publishing 22 Books Taught Me Cover Design"

Each article targets a specific search keyword and funnels readers toward the services page.

### 7. Indie Author Communities

Active participation in communities where indie authors discuss publishing:

- Reddit: r/selfpublish, r/writing, r/KDP
- Facebook Groups: Self-Publishing groups, KDP author communities
- Twitter/X: #IndieAuthor, #BookCoverDesign, #SelfPublishing, #WritingCommunity
- Discord: Self-publishing and author servers

**Approach:** Provide genuine value (answering questions about cover design, KDP formatting, series branding) with a professional signature linking to metronagon.com. No spam, no hard sells — just visible expertise.

## Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Target

Since the business operates with minimal overhead and the founder handles all marketing personally:

- **Target CAC:** $0–$25 per client (organic discovery via SEO, social media, and Reedsy)
- **Paid advertising:** Not planned for Phase 1. May be introduced in Phase 2 if organic growth plateaus.
- **Referral incentive:** The 10% returning client discount encourages repeat business and word-of-mouth referrals

## Client Retention Strategy

- **Returning Client Discount** — 10% off any future order rewards loyalty
- **Update & Revision services** — Low-cost add-ons keep clients in the ecosystem
- **Add New Book Cover** — $125 for existing series clients (below standalone pricing) creates a natural path for authors expanding their series
- **Quality and speed** — The primary retention driver: deliver excellent work fast, and clients will return
