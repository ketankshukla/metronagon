# Digital Portfolio & Proof of Work

## Overview

Metronagon Media's most powerful business asset is its verifiable portfolio. Unlike most new creative businesses that launch with mock-ups or stock-image samples, every piece of work in the Metronagon portfolio was created for real, published books that anyone can verify on Amazon. This section documents the full scope of that portfolio.
