## Phase 3: Scaling (Year 2)

### Objective
Approach Reedsy-competitive pricing, maximize revenue per client, and explore expansion opportunities.

### Key Actions

**Premium Positioning**

- Raise prices toward Reedsy entry-level ($300–$500 for single covers)
- Introduce a "Portfolio" or "VIP" tier for premium clients wanting the highest level of service
- Position Metronagon as a mid-tier professional option, not a budget alternative
- Update all marketing materials to reflect the elevated positioning

**Revenue Optimization**

- Increase average order value through upselling (cover → branding → pipeline)
- Introduce package add-ons beyond current offerings (e.g., Amazon A+ Content graphics, social media promotion graphics, author website design)
- Develop a "Series Completion" package for authors who purchased branding and are adding books
- Create holiday/seasonal bundles

**Operational Scaling**

- If demand exceeds solo capacity (~15–20 projects/month), evaluate options:
  - Increase prices to reduce volume while maintaining revenue
  - Develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) for potential subcontracting
  - Create template systems that reduce per-project time investment
- Invest in workflow automation where possible

**Brand Authority**

- Publish a comprehensive guide: "The Indie Author's Complete Guide to Book Cover Design"
- Speak at virtual indie publishing conferences
- Build an email list for direct marketing to interested authors
- Develop a "Metronagon Method" brand around the creative process

### Milestones

| Milestone | Target |
| --- | --- |
| 50+ completed client projects | Month 15–18 |
| 30+ five-star reviews | Month 14–16 |
| Monthly revenue > $8,000 | Month 13–18 |
| Annual revenue > $80,000 | End of Year 2 |
| Average order value > $500 | Month 18–24 |

---

## Phase 4: Long-Term Vision (Year 3+)

### Possible Expansion Directions

1. **Author Website Design** — Leverage the Next.js expertise used to build 5 portfolio websites. Offer website design packages to indie authors ($500–$2,000 per site).

2. **Amazon A+ Content** — Design enhanced product page graphics for Amazon listings. A natural extension of cover design for KDP authors.

3. **Social Media Graphics** — Book launch graphics, BookTok promotional images, Instagram post templates. Low-effort add-ons with high perceived value.

4. **Online Course** — "Design Your Own Book Covers" — monetize the knowledge and process into a digital product with passive income potential.

5. **Template Marketplace** — Sell pre-designed cover templates that authors can customize with their own titles and text. Lower price point ($20–$50) but scalable passive income.

6. **Children's Book Publishing** — Develop and publish original children's books as Metronagon titles, combining the illustration capability with the founder's publishing experience.

7. **Agency Model** — If demand warrants, transition from solo operator to a small studio with 1–2 contracted designers working under the Metronagon brand and quality standards.

### Revenue Targets

| Year | Conservative | Moderate | Optimistic |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Year 1 | $25,000–$34,000 | $37,000–$51,000 | $60,000–$80,000 |
| Year 2 | $50,000–$65,000 | $75,000–$100,000 | $110,000–$150,000 |
| Year 3 | $70,000–$90,000 | $100,000–$140,000 | $150,000–$200,000+ |

### Long-Term Competitive Position

The ultimate goal is for Metronagon Media to be recognized as:

- A **trusted mid-to-premium book cover design service** in the indie publishing ecosystem
- The **go-to option for series branding** — leveraging the founder's unique 22-book, 3-series portfolio as permanent credibility
- A **one-stop creative partner** for indie authors who want professional-quality visuals without managing multiple freelancers
- A business with **sustainable pricing power** — commanding rates comparable to established Reedsy professionals, justified by a deep portfolio and extensive client review history
