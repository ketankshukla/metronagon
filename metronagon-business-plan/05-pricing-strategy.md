# Pricing Strategy

## Pricing Philosophy

Metronagon Media's pricing is designed around a single principle: **charge enough to signal professionalism, but not so much that the lack of client reviews becomes a barrier to trust.**

The founder has zero paid client history. No testimonials, no marketplace ratings, no repeat customer base. The portfolio — while extensive and verifiable — consists entirely of self-produced work. This is an honest assessment, and the pricing reflects it.

At the same time, the work quality is demonstrably above Fiverr-tier output. The 22-book portfolio, 3 complete series, and 5 live websites prove capability. The prices must sit above budget platforms and below established professionals — a deliberate strategic position.

### Add-Ons

| Add-On | Price |
| --- | --- |
| Rush Fee — 48hr Turnaround | +50% of base price |
| Returning Client Discount | -10% off any new order |

## Pricing Rationale

### Why Not Cheaper

- $150 for a single front cover is above Fiverr's typical $25–$100 range
- It signals "I take this seriously" without demanding established-professional trust levels
- Children's books at $500 for 32 illustrations represent genuine value at ~$15/illustration
- Pricing below $100 would attract bargain hunters and devalue the portfolio

### Why Not More Expensive

- Every price is below Reedsy's entry-level for comparable work
- A client who cannot verify reviews or client testimonials will not pay $500+ for a single cover from an unknown designer
- Bundles offer clear savings over buying covers individually, incentivizing larger orders
- The goal is volume and reviews first, premium pricing second

### Bundle Economics

The pricing structure deliberately rewards larger orders:

| Buying Strategy | Total Cost | Per-Cover Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5 individual Standard covers | $750 | $150/cover |
| Branding Standard (5 Books) | $600 | $120/cover |
| Pipeline Standard (5 Books) | $850 | $170/cover (includes logo, box set, descriptions) |
| 10 individual Standard covers | $1,500 | $150/cover |
| Branding Premium (10 Books) | $950 | $95/cover |
| Pipeline Premium (10 Books) | $1,350 | $135/cover (includes logo, box set, descriptions) |

This makes series branding and pipeline packages the obvious value choice for authors planning multi-book series — which is exactly the highest-value customer segment.

## Price Comparison: Current vs. Market

| Package | Metronagon (Now) | Reedsy Entry | Reedsy Mid-Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Single cover | $150–$250 | $500–$700 | $750–$1,200 |
| 3-book branding | $400 | $1,200–$1,800 | $2,000–$3,000 |
| 5-book branding | $600 | $2,000–$2,800 | $3,000–$4,500 |
| 10-book branding | $950 | $3,000–$4,500 | $5,000–$7,000+ |
| Children's (32 pages) | $500–$900 | $1,800–$2,500 | $2,800–$4,000 |
| 5-book pipeline | $850 | $2,800–$3,800 | $4,000–$6,000 |

Metronagon's current prices represent a **60–75% discount** compared to established Reedsy professionals. This is intentional for the launch phase.

## Planned Price Evolution

The pricing strategy includes a deliberate escalation path tied to reputation milestones:

### Phase 1: Launch (Months 1–6)

- **Target:** Build client base, accumulate first 10–15 reviews
- **Prices:** Current rates (as listed above)
- **Focus:** Volume, speed, client satisfaction, five-star reviews

### Phase 2: Established (Months 7–12)

- **Target:** 15–25 total reviews, 4.8+ average rating
- **Price increases:**
  - Cover Standard: $150 → $200–$250
  - Cover Premium: $250 → $350–$400
  - Branding packages: +30–40%
  - Pipeline packages: +30–40%
  - Children's packages: +40–50%
- **Justification:** Review history now provides social proof

### Phase 3: Premium (Year 2+)

- **Target:** 25+ reviews, recognized name in indie author communities
- **Price increases:**
  - Cover Standard: $300–$400
  - Cover Premium: $400–$600
  - Branding packages: Approaching Reedsy entry-level
  - Pipeline packages: $1,500–$3,000 range
  - Children's packages: $1,000–$1,500+
- **Justification:** Proven track record with paying clients, not just self-work

## Payment Processing

All payments are processed through **Stripe** using embedded checkout on metronagon.com.

- **Payment mode:** One-time payments (no subscriptions or recurring billing)

- **Promotion codes:** Supported — allows for discount campaigns and returning client codes
- **Currency:** USD

## Refund Policy

As a digital services business, refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis. The general approach:

- If work has not yet begun, a full refund is issued
- If concepts have been delivered and the client is unsatisfied beyond revision scope, a partial refund may be considered
- The included revision rounds are designed to address most satisfaction concerns before refund conversations arise
