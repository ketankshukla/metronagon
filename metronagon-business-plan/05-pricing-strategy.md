# Pricing Strategy

## Pricing Philosophy

Metronagon Media's pricing is designed around a single principle: **charge enough to signal professionalism, but not so much that the lack of client reviews becomes a barrier to trust.**

The founder has zero paid client history. No testimonials, no marketplace ratings, no repeat customer base. The portfolio — while extensive and verifiable — consists entirely of self-produced work. This is an honest assessment, and the pricing reflects it.

At the same time, the work quality is demonstrably above Fiverr-tier output. The 22-book portfolio, 3 complete series, and 5 live websites prove capability. The prices must sit above budget platforms and below established professionals — a deliberate strategic position.

## Pricing Rationale

### Why These Prices

- $450 for a single front cover positions Metronagon at the entry point of Reedsy's professional range ($500–$700)
- Each cover starts with a 2,500–3,000 word creative brief — 8–12 hours of skilled professional work per cover
- Children's books at $1,800 for 32 illustrations represent ~$56/illustration — professional rate for consistent, high-quality character work
- The AI Transparency page (metronagon.com/ai-transparency) demonstrates the depth of the creative process, justifying professional rates
- 22 published books across 3 series provide verifiable proof of quality

### Why Not Higher

- Zero Reedsy client reviews means pricing at the top of the range would be premature
- Current prices sit at entry-to-mid professional range, with clear room to grow as reviews accumulate
- Bundle economics reward commitment — per-cover rates decrease with larger packages

### Bundle Economics

The pricing structure deliberately rewards larger orders:

| Buying Strategy               | Total Cost | Per-Cover Cost                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 5 individual Standard covers  | $2,250     | $450/cover                                        |
| Branding Standard (5 Books)   | $2,200     | $440/cover                                        |
| Pipeline Standard (5 Books)   | $2,800     | $560/cover (includes logo, box set, descriptions) |
| 10 individual Standard covers | $4,500     | $450/cover                                        |
| Branding Premium (10 Books)   | $3,500     | $350/cover                                        |
| Pipeline Premium (10 Books)   | $4,500     | $450/cover (includes logo, box set, descriptions) |

This makes series branding and pipeline packages the obvious value choice for authors planning multi-book series — which is exactly the highest-value customer segment.

## Price Comparison: Current vs. Market

| Package               | Metronagon (Now) | Reedsy Entry  | Reedsy Mid-Range |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Single cover          | $450–$650        | $500–$700     | $750–$1,200      |
| 3-book branding       | $1,400           | $1,200–$1,800 | $2,000–$3,000    |
| 5-book branding       | $2,200           | $2,000–$2,800 | $3,000–$4,500    |
| 10-book branding      | $3,500           | $3,000–$4,500 | $5,000–$7,000+   |
| Children's (32 pages) | $1,800–$3,200    | $1,800–$2,500 | $2,800–$4,000    |
| 5-book pipeline       | $2,800           | $2,800–$3,800 | $4,000–$6,000    |

Metronagon's current prices sit at the **entry-to-mid point of Reedsy's professional range**, justified by the depth of creative work (2,500–3,000 word briefs per cover), 22-book portfolio, and AI Transparency documentation.

## Payment Processing

All payments are processed through **Stripe** using embedded checkout on metronagon.com.

- **Payment mode:** One-time payments (no subscriptions or recurring billing)
- **Checkout flow:** Client selects package → clicks "Get Started" → Stripe embedded checkout → payment confirmation → thank-you page with requirements questionnaire
- **Promotion codes:** Supported — allows for discount campaigns and returning client codes
- **Currency:** USD
- **Stripe fees:** ~2.9% + $0.30 per transaction (standard Stripe processing)

## Refund Policy

As a digital services business, refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis. The general approach:

- If concepts have been delivered and the client is unsatisfied beyond revision scope, a partial refund may be considered
- The included revision rounds are designed to address most satisfaction concerns before refund conversations arise
