# Risk Analysis

## Risk Categories

This section identifies the key risks facing Metronagon Media and outlines mitigation strategies for each.

---

## 1. Market & Demand Risks

### Risk: Insufficient Client Demand

**Severity:** High | **Likelihood:** Medium

The business may struggle to attract enough paying clients in the early months, particularly given the lack of client reviews and marketplace presence.

**Mitigation:**

- Pricing is deliberately set below market rates to reduce the trust barrier
- The 22-book portfolio provides tangible proof of capability that most new businesses cannot match
- Multiple marketing channels (SEO, social media, Reedsy, community engagement) reduce dependence on any single discovery path
- Low operating costs mean the business remains viable even at very low order volumes (break-even at 1 order/month)

### Risk: Market Saturation

**Severity:** Medium | **Likelihood:** Medium

The book cover design market has a large number of providers, particularly at the budget end. Standing out requires differentiation.

**Mitigation:**

- Clear positioning in the strategic middle ground between Fiverr and Reedsy
- Unique selling proposition: designer who is also a 22-book published author
- Bundled packages (branding + pipeline) that budget competitors cannot match
- Continuous portfolio expansion through both self-work and client work

### Risk: AI Disruption

**Severity:** Medium | **Likelihood:** High

AI image generation tools are becoming more accessible to non-designers. Some authors may attempt to create their own covers using free or low-cost AI tools.

**Mitigation:**

- Metronagon already leverages AI as part of its production pipeline — the competitive advantage is not the tool but the creative direction, typography, composition, and series-level consistency
- DIY AI covers are often identifiable by their generic quality, poor typography, and lack of series cohesion — this creates demand for professional finishing
- As AI tools commoditize basic image generation, the value shifts to curation, art direction, and professional polish — exactly what Metronagon provides
- Children's book illustration requires multi-page character consistency that casual AI users struggle to achieve

## 2. Operational Risks

### Risk: Capacity Constraints

**Severity:** Medium | **Likelihood:** Medium (if demand exceeds expectations)

As a solo operation, the founder can handle approximately 15–20 projects per month at full capacity. Unexpected demand surges could lead to delayed deliveries or quality compromises.

**Mitigation:**

- Rush Fee (+50%) naturally throttles urgent requests and compensates for accelerated timelines
- Clear delivery windows on every package set accurate expectations
- If sustained demand exceeds capacity: raise prices (reducing volume while increasing revenue per project) or develop subcontracting relationships with vetted designers
- Template and process optimization reduces per-project time investment over time

### Risk: Founder Dependency

**Severity:** High | **Likelihood:** Low (health/personal)

The business is entirely dependent on one person. Illness, personal emergencies, or burnout could halt all operations.

**Mitigation:**

- Digital business with no physical inventory means operations can pause and resume without loss
- Stripe payment system operates independently — no active management required when not processing orders
- If extended absence is anticipated, a "temporarily paused" status can be implemented on the website
- Long-term: develop SOPs that would allow a contracted designer to fulfill orders under the Metronagon brand

### Risk: Quality Inconsistency

**Severity:** High | **Likelihood:** Low

Maintaining consistent quality across different genres, styles, and project types is critical. A single poor delivery could generate a negative review that outweighs multiple positive ones.

**Mitigation:**

- Standardized QA checklist for every deliverable (dimensions, typography, genre accuracy, series consistency, Amazon compliance)
- Revision rounds built into every package as a safety net
- Clear scope definitions prevent over-promising
- The founder's own publishing experience provides a strong internal quality benchmark

## 3. Financial Risks

### Risk: Pricing Too Low

**Severity:** Medium | **Likelihood:** Medium

If prices are set too low, the business may attract bargain-hunting clients with unrealistic expectations, leading to excessive revision requests and low satisfaction despite high effort.

**Mitigation:**

- Current prices are above Fiverr rates, signaling professionalism
- Clear package descriptions and FAQ set accurate expectations
- Revision rounds are limited (1–2 per package), preventing scope creep
- Planned price increases over 6–12 months will gradually shift the client profile toward higher-value customers

### Risk: Stripe Platform Dependency

**Severity:** Medium | **Likelihood:** Low

All payment processing depends on Stripe. Account issues, policy changes, or platform outages could disrupt revenue.

**Mitigation:**

- Stripe is an industry-standard payment processor with high reliability
- Business operations are straightforward (one-time payments, no recurring billing) — easy to migrate to an alternative processor if needed
- No exclusive lock-in — the website can be modified to support alternative payment providers (PayPal, Square, etc.)

### Risk: Chargebacks and Disputes

**Severity:** Low | **Likelihood:** Low

Digital services carry some risk of payment disputes, particularly if clients are unsatisfied with creative output.

**Mitigation:**

- Revision rounds address most satisfaction concerns before disputes arise
- Clear scope definitions on the services page and post-purchase questionnaire establish expectations
- Stripe's dispute resolution process provides a structured framework for handling claims
- The "pay first, deliver second" model means work is never performed without payment confirmation

## 4. Reputational Risks

### Risk: Negative Reviews

**Severity:** High | **Likelihood:** Low

A single negative review, especially on Reedsy or a public platform, could disproportionately impact a new business with few total reviews.

**Mitigation:**

- Quality-first approach to every project — over-deliver on early orders to build goodwill
- Proactive communication throughout the project lifecycle
- Revision rounds as a formal mechanism for addressing concerns
- If a genuine mistake occurs: acknowledge it, fix it, and offer compensation (partial refund, additional revision, or complimentary add-on)
- The goal is to make every early client a vocal advocate

### Risk: Portfolio Perception

**Severity:** Medium | **Likelihood:** Medium

Some potential clients may perceive the self-produced portfolio as less credible than client work. "You designed covers for your own books" may carry less weight than "You designed covers for paying clients."

**Mitigation:**

- The portfolio is verifiable on Amazon — it's real published work, not mock-ups
- As client work accumulates, it will gradually replace self-work as the primary portfolio showcase
- Pricing reflects this honest assessment — rates are below what the portfolio quality might otherwise command
- The 22-book portfolio demonstrates consistency and range that is genuinely impressive regardless of whether the client was external or internal

## 5. Technology Risks

### Risk: Website Downtime

**Severity:** Medium | **Likelihood:** Low

If metronagon.com goes down, clients cannot browse services, make purchases, or access post-purchase information.

**Mitigation:**

- Vercel hosting provides 99.99% uptime SLA with global CDN
- Automatic deployments from GitHub ensure the latest version is always live
- No database dependency — the site is statically generated with client-side Stripe integration
- DNS and domain management through standard registrars with redundancy

### Risk: AI Tool Changes

**Severity:** Medium | **Likelihood:** Medium

AI image generation platforms may change pricing, policies, or capabilities, affecting the production pipeline.

**Mitigation:**

- The creative pipeline is not dependent on any single AI tool — multiple platforms can produce comparable results
- The value-add is in creative direction, post-processing, and typography — not in any specific generation tool
- Continuous evaluation of emerging tools ensures the pipeline stays current
