# Company Overview

## Legal Structure

Metronagon Media operates as a sole proprietorship based in San Diego, California, United States. The business provides digital creative services to clients worldwide, with all transactions processed electronically and all deliverables transmitted digitally.

## Business Name & Identity

**Metronagon Media** — derived from two Greek words:

- **Metron** (μέτρον) — Measure. Standard. The right proportion.
- **Agon** (ἀγών) — Contest. Struggle. The pursuit of excellence.

Together: **The Measure of Excellence.**

The name reflects the company's core philosophy — that creative work should be measured, precise, and relentlessly refined. Every deliverable is held to the same standard the founder holds for his own published work.

## Mission Statement

Metronagon Media exists to provide indie authors and self-publishers with professional-quality book covers, series branding, and publishing visuals — at accessible prices, with fast turnaround, from a designer who understands the publishing process because he lives it.

## Core Values

### Quality Over Quantity

Every deliverable meets the same standard held for the founder's own published work. No template covers, no generic stock-image compositions, no shortcuts.

### Proven, Not Theoretical

Everything offered as a service has been tested and refined on the founder's own 22-book publishing journey. Every cover system, every branding approach, every series design methodology has been through real production before being offered to clients.

### End-to-End Thinking

Covers are not designed in isolation. Every design decision considers how the cover fits the series, the genre, the Amazon platform, and the reader's expectations. Context drives every creative choice.
