# Executive Summary

## Business Concept

Metronagon Media is a digital creative services business specializing in professional book cover design, series branding, children's book illustration, and full publishing pipeline packages for indie authors and self-publishers. The business operates as a solo creative studio run by Ketan Shukla — a published Amazon KDP author with 22 books across 3 complete series — who now offers the same production pipeline that created his own published works as a commercial service to other authors.

## The Opportunity

The self-publishing industry has experienced explosive growth. Amazon KDP alone processes millions of new titles annually, and every one of those books needs a professional cover. The demand for affordable, high-quality book cover design far outstrips the supply of designers who understand the indie publishing ecosystem from the inside.

Most book cover designers fall into two camps:

1. **Fiverr-level freelancers** ($25–$100) who produce generic, template-based covers with no understanding of series branding or Amazon optimization
2. **Established Reedsy professionals** ($500–$1,200+) who command premium rates justified by years of client reviews and marketplace presence

Metronagon Media positions itself as a professional-tier option — offering high-quality work backed by a real 22-book published portfolio and detailed creative process documentation, at prices that sit within Reedsy's professional range.

## What We Sell

Metronagon Media offers four categories of digital creative services, all delivered remotely:

- **Front Cover Design** — Single Kindle/paperback front covers ($450–$650)
- **Series Branding** — Multi-book cover suites with logo and box set cover ($1,400–$3,500)
- **Children's Picture Book Illustration** — 32-page illustrated books with covers and assembled PDFs ($1,800–$3,200)
- **Full Publishing Pipeline** — Complete packages combining covers, logo, box set cover, and Amazon book descriptions ($1,800–$4,500)

Additionally, we offer **Updates & Revisions** for existing clients ($75–$350) and **Add-ons** including rush delivery (+50%) and a returning client discount (-10%).

## Competitive Advantage

Metronagon Media's competitive advantage is threefold:

1. **Proven portfolio** — 22 published books, 3 complete series, 30+ character portraits, and 100+ cover designs — all verifiable on Amazon and across 5 live portfolio websites
2. **Insider expertise** — The founder has navigated the entire KDP publishing process as an author, understanding not just design but also Amazon listing optimization, series structure, and reader expectations
3. **End-to-end capability** — Unlike most cover designers who offer a single deliverable, Metronagon packages covers, logos, box sets, and book descriptions into comprehensive bundles that save authors time and money

## Revenue Model

All revenue comes from one-time project payments processed through Stripe. There are no subscriptions, retainers, or recurring fees. Clients select a package on the website, pay securely, and receive their deliverables within 1–4 business days depending on the package.

The pricing structure is designed to:

- Position at the entry-to-mid point of Reedsy's professional range, justified by portfolio quality and process depth
- Offer clear value through bundled packages (e.g., 10-book branding at ~$350/cover vs. $450 for a standalone cover)
- Scale upward as client reviews and marketplace reputation grow

The long-term vision is to become a recognized name in the indie author services space — known for quality, thoroughness, and the unique credibility of a designer who is also a published author with 22 books.
