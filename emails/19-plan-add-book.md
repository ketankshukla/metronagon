Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your order! I'll have the new book integrated into your series plan within **2 business days**.

Please reply with the following:

1. **Series name** and **which book number** this is (e.g., "Book 4 in the Aztec series")
2. **Where does this book fit in the series?** (Sequel to the last book? A prequel? A midquel between existing books?)
3. **Book concept** — 3–5 sentences about what happens in this book
4. **Main character focus** — Is this the same protagonist, or are we introducing someone new?
5. **Key plot points** — Any specific events or reveals that must happen in this book?
6. **How does it connect to the existing plan?** — Which threads, characters, or plotlines carry over from previous books?
7. **Ending direction** — Does this book resolve anything, or set up the next one?
8. **Attach your existing series plan** (or reference your original order so I can pull it up)
