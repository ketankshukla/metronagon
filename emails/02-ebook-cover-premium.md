Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for choosing the Premium cover package! This is our highest-quality single-cover option, and I'm going to make sure you get something exceptional.

To get started, I need a few details from you. Please reply to this email with the following:

## Book Details

1. **Book title** (and subtitle, if any)
2. **Author name** (exactly as it should appear on the cover)
3. **Genre** (e.g., thriller, romance, sci-fi, fantasy, literary fiction, etc.)
4. **Brief book description** (2–3 sentences about the story or subject matter)
5. **Target audience** — Who is your ideal reader? (e.g., young adults, women 30–50, fans of Brandon Sanderson, etc.)

## Visual Direction

6. **Mood/tone** — What feeling should the cover evoke? (e.g., dark and intense, warm and hopeful, mysterious, epic, whimsical)
7. **Key visual elements** — Are there specific objects, scenes, or symbols that should appear? (e.g., a lone figure in a forest, a city skyline at night, a glowing artifact)
8. **Color preferences** — Any colors you love or want to avoid?
9. **Specific scene or moment** — Is there a particular scene from the book you'd love captured on the cover?

## Reference Covers

10. **3–5 existing book covers you admire** — Covers whose style, composition, or mood you'd want yours to echo. Links or titles are fine. The more references, the more precisely I can dial in your vision.
11. **Covers you DON'T like** — Any styles or looks you want to avoid? This is just as helpful as knowing what you want.

## Typography

12. **Font style preference** — Serif (classic), sans-serif (modern), script (elegant), or display (bold/decorative)? If you're not sure, I'll choose based on your genre — just say "your call."
13. **Any specific text beyond title and author?** (e.g., "A New York Times Bestseller," series name, tagline)

## Publishing Platform

14. **Where will this be published?** (Amazon KDP, IngramSpark, other?) This ensures I deliver the exact file specs you need.
