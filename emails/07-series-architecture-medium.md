**Subject:** Your Series Architecture Plan — Let's Get Started!

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your order! I'm excited to help you plan and structure your 5-book series.

To get started, I need a few details from you. Please reply to this email with the following:

## Series Overview

1. **Series name** (if you have one)
2. **Genre** (e.g., thriller, romance, sci-fi, fantasy, literary fiction, etc.)
3. **Target audience** — Who is your ideal reader?
4. **Series concept** — Describe the overall idea in 4–6 sentences. What's the big story you're telling across all 5 books?

## Story Foundation

5. **Main character(s)** — Who is the protagonist (or ensemble)? Brief description of who they are, what they want, and what's standing in their way.
6. **Central conflict** — What is the core problem or struggle that drives the series?
7. **Setting** — Where and when does the story take place? Include any world-building details you have (magic systems, technology, political structures, etc.)
8. **Mid-series pivot** — In a 5-book series, something usually shifts around book 3. Do you have any ideas about what that turning point might be? (e.g., a betrayal, a revelation, a power shift)
9. **Ending direction** — Do you have a sense of how the series ends? Even a vague idea helps.

## Existing Material

10. **Have you written any of these books yet?** If so, which ones and how far along are they?
11. **Do you have any outlines, notes, or ideas already?** Feel free to attach anything — even rough notes are helpful.
12. **Are there any plot points or scenes you're committed to?** (Things that MUST happen in the series)
13. **Are there any subplots or secondary characters you already know you want?**

## Tone & Influences

14. **Comparable books or series** — What published series is yours most similar to?
15. **Pacing preference** — Fast and action-packed, slow-burn and character-driven, or a mix?
16. **Emotional tone** — Dark and gritty, hopeful and uplifting, morally complex, humorous, etc.?

## Publishing Plans

17. **How will these be published?** (Self-published on Amazon, traditional publishing, other?)
18. **Target book length** — Any word count targets per book?
19. **Release cadence** — How often do you plan to release? (e.g., one every 3 months, one per year)
