**Subject:** Your Premium Series Branding — Let's Get Started!

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for choosing the Premium branding package! This is our most comprehensive visual identity offering, and I'm going to make sure your series looks absolutely stunning across every touchpoint.

To get started, I need a few details from you. Please reply to this email with the following:

## Series Overview

1. **Series name** (if you have one)
2. **Genre** (e.g., thriller, romance, sci-fi, fantasy, literary fiction, etc.)
3. **Brief series description** (4–5 sentences about the overall story arc or theme)
4. **Target audience** — Who is your ideal reader?
5. **Total number of books** — How many books are planned for this series?

## Individual Book Details

For **each book** in the series, please provide:

6. **Book title** (and subtitle, if any)
7. **Brief description** (2–3 sentences — what happens in this book specifically?)
8. **Key visual element or scene** — What should this particular cover convey?
9. **Where does this book fall in the emotional arc?** (e.g., "this is the darkest book," "this is the triumphant finale," "this is the mysterious setup")

## Visual Direction (Applies to All Covers)

10. **Mood/tone** — What feeling should the series evoke? (e.g., dark and intense, warm and hopeful, mysterious, epic)
11. **Color palette preferences** — Any colors you love or want to avoid? All covers will share a unified palette.
12. **Style preference** — Photorealistic or stylized?
13. **Key recurring visual element** — Is there an object, symbol, or motif that ties the series together?
14. **Visual progression** — Should the covers evolve visually across the series? (e.g., getting darker, shifting color, escalating scale)

## Reference Covers

15. **5+ existing book covers or series you admire** — Especially series with consistent branding. Links or titles are fine. The more references, the better.
16. **Covers you DON'T like** — Any styles or looks you want to avoid?

## Logo

17. **Series logo direction** — Any ideas? Or "your call" if you'd like me to design based on the series theme.

## Panoramic Cover

18. **Panoramic scene direction** — This is a wide-format image connecting major characters or elements across the series. Any specific scene, characters, or setting you envision? Or should I design this based on the series arc?

## Author Portrait

19. **Author portrait direction** — This will be rendered in the series' visual style. Do you want it based on a real photo of yourself (please attach one), or a stylized/fictional representation? Any specific setting or mood?

## YouTube Thumbnail

20. **Thumbnail purpose** — What will this be used for? Any specific text or tagline?

## Typography & Author Name

21. **Author name** (exactly as it should appear on all covers)
22. **Font style preference** — Or "your call" if you'd like me to choose.

## Publishing Platform

23. **Where will this be published?** (Amazon KDP, IngramSpark, other?)
