**Subject:** Your Logo Refresh — What's the New Direction?

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your order! I'll have your updated or redesigned series logo ready within **2 business days**.

Please reply with the following:

1. **Series name** the logo is for
2. **Attach your current logo** (or reference your original order)
3. **What needs to change?** Options include:
   - Modernize the existing design (keep the concept, refine the execution)
   - Completely new design direction
   - Adjust colors, fonts, or proportions
   - Adapt for a new use case (e.g., needs to work better at small sizes, needs a dark-mode version)
4. **New direction details** (if redesigning):
   - Any new visual ideas, symbols, or styles?
   - New color preferences?
   - Any logos from other brands or series you admire as reference?
5. **What should stay the same?** (e.g., "keep the symbol but change the font," "keep the color but modernize the shape")
6. **Where will the logo be used?** (Book covers, social media, website, print materials, all of the above?)

I'll deliver the refreshed logo (PNG + SVG) within **2 business days**.

Best,
