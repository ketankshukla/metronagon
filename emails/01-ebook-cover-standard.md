# Ebook Cover Design — Standard ($75)

**Subject:** Your Ebook Cover Design — Let's Get Started!

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your order! I'm excited to design your ebook cover.

To get started, I need a few details from you. Please reply to this email with the following:

## Book Details

1. **Book title** (and subtitle, if any)
2. **Author name** (exactly as it should appear on the cover)
3. **Genre** (e.g., thriller, romance, sci-fi, fantasy, literary fiction, etc.)
4. **Brief book description** (2–3 sentences about the story or subject matter)

## Visual Direction

5. **Mood/tone** — What feeling should the cover evoke? (e.g., dark and intense, warm and hopeful, mysterious, epic, whimsical)
6. **Key visual elements** — Are there specific objects, scenes, or symbols that should appear? (e.g., a lone figure in a forest, a city skyline at night, a glowing artifact)
7. **Color preferences** — Any colors you love or want to avoid?
8. **Style preference** — Photorealistic (cinematic, like a movie poster) or stylized (illustrated, artistic)?

## Reference Covers

9. **2–3 existing book covers you admire** — These don't have to be in your genre. Just covers whose style, composition, or mood you'd want yours to echo. Links or titles are fine.

## Typography

10. **Font style preference** — Any preference for serif (classic), sans-serif (modern), script (elegant), or display (bold/decorative)? If you're not sure, I'll choose based on your genre — just say "your call."

## Publishing Platform

11. **Where will this be published?** (Amazon KDP, IngramSpark, other?) This ensures I deliver the exact file specs you need.

That's it! Once I have your answers, I'll begin working on your 3 concept variations. You'll receive all 3 concepts within **2 business days**, and then you choose your favorite for final polish.

If you have any questions, just reply to this email.

Looking forward to creating something great for you.

Best,
