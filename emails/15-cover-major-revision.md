# Cover — Major Revision ($50)

**Subject:** Your Cover Revision — Tell Me Your New Vision

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your order! A major revision means we're taking the cover in a new direction. I'll have your updated cover ready within **2 business days**.

To get started, please reply with the following:

1. **Which cover is this for?** (Book title and, if applicable, which version/order)

2. **What's not working with the current cover?** Understanding what you want to move away from is just as important as knowing what you want.

3. **What's the new direction?** Major revisions include:
   - Completely new concept or scene
   - Different visual style (e.g., switching from photorealistic to stylized)
   - Full layout overhaul (new composition, different focal point)
   - Significant mood or tone shift
   - New color palette

4. **Updated visual brief:**
   - **New mood/tone** — What feeling should the revised cover evoke?
   - **New key visual elements** — What should appear on the cover now?
   - **New color preferences** — Any changes?

5. **Reference covers** — 2–3 covers that represent the new direction you want.

6. **Attach the current cover file** (or reference your original order)

7. **Should anything stay the same?** (e.g., "keep the typography but change the imagery," "keep the color palette but change the scene")

I'll send the revised cover within **2 business days** of receiving your reply.

Best,
