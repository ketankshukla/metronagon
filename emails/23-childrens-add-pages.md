# Children's Book — Add Pages ($40/page)

**Subject:** Adding Pages to Your Book — What's the New Content?

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your order! I'll create the new pages at **1 day per page**, matching the existing style of your book.

Please reply with the following:

1. **Book title** this is for
2. **How many new pages** are you adding?
3. **Where do the new pages go?** (e.g., "after page 12," "at the end before the last page," "between pages 8 and 9")
4. **For each new page, describe:**
   - **Story text** — What text goes on this page? (1–3 sentences)
   - **Illustration description** — What should the image show? Include character poses, setting, mood, and any specific details.
   - **Connection** — How does this page flow from the previous one and into the next?
5. **Attach the current book PDF** (or reference your original order)
6. **Any new characters or settings?** If a new page introduces something that hasn't appeared before, describe it in detail.

I'll illustrate each new page in the same style as the rest of the book and deliver updated files within **1 day per page**.

Best,
