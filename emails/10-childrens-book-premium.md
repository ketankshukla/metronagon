Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for choosing the Premium picture book package! This is our top-tier children's book offering — you'll receive custom character design, print-ready formatting, and the highest quality illustrations on every page.

To get started, I need a few details from you. Please reply to this email with the following:

## Story Details

1. **Do you have a story written already?** If yes, please attach it. If not, I'll write one based on your concept — just provide the details below.
2. **Book concept** — What is the story about? (4–6 sentences describing the idea, the main character, and the journey or lesson)
3. **Target age group** — (e.g., 2–4, 4–6, 6–8)
4. **Main character(s)** — Name, age, appearance (hair color, skin tone, clothing, any distinguishing features, personality traits). I'll create a full **character reference sheet** before illustration begins, so the more detail you provide, the better.
5. **Supporting characters** — Any other characters who appear? Descriptions for each.
6. **Setting** — Where does the story take place? Multiple settings? Describe each.
7. **Tone** — Fun and silly, gentle and calming, adventurous, educational, etc.?
8. **Lesson or message** — Is there a moral, lesson, or theme?
9. **Emotional arc** — How should the reader feel at the beginning vs. the end? (e.g., "starts curious, ends proud" or "starts scared, ends brave")

## Visual Direction

10. **Art style preference** — Pixar/Disney-inspired, watercolor, flat illustration, or other? If not sure, say "your call."
11. **Color palette** — Bright and colorful, soft pastels, warm earth tones, or specific colors?
12. **Reference books or art** — Any existing children's books whose illustration style you admire? List 3–5 if possible.
13. **Visual details that matter** — Any specific objects, animals, or elements that must appear? (e.g., "the character always carries a red backpack," "there's a friendly owl")

## Text & Layout

14. **How much text per page?** — 1–3 sentences is standard. Preference?
15. **Any pages with no text?** — Full-bleed illustration pages?
16. **Text placement preference** — Text overlaid on illustrations, or in a separate area below/beside the art?

## Print Details (Premium Feature)

17. **Trim size** — Standard is 8.5" × 8.5" square. Other options: 8" × 10" portrait, 10" × 8" landscape. Preference?
18. **Print-on-demand service** — Amazon KDP Print, IngramSpark, or other? I'll format to their exact specifications (bleed, margins, gutter, color profile).
19. **Hardcover or softcover?** — This affects spine width calculations.
20. **ISBN** — Do you have one, or will you use a free Amazon-assigned one?

## Special Pages

21. **Title page design** — Any specific vision?
22. **Copyright page text** — I'll format it properly, but do you have your copyright holder name and year?
23. **Dedication page text** — (e.g., "For my little adventurer, Emma")
24. **Back cover** — Any specific text, tagline, or barcode area needed?
25. **Any special requests?** — Hidden details, Easter eggs, a specific scene you've always imagined, etc.

Here's what happens next:

1. I review your brief and create a **custom character design system** (front view, side view, expressions, clothing reference sheet)
2. I write or adapt the story (if needed) and plan the page-by-page layout
3. All **32 pages are illustrated** with multiple generation passes per page for premium quality
4. The book is **formatted to print-ready specs** (proper bleed, margins, gutter, CMYK-safe colors)
5. You receive the **complete print-ready PDF + individual page files + story text document** within **7 business days**
6. You get **2 rounds of revisions** to adjust any pages

Everything delivered via Google Drive or ZIP.
