**Subject:** Your Series Architecture Plan — Let's Get Started!

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your order! I'm excited to help you plan and structure your 3-book series.

To get started, I need a few details from you. Please reply to this email with the following:

## Series Overview

1. **Series name** (if you have one)
2. **Genre** (e.g., thriller, romance, sci-fi, fantasy, literary fiction, etc.)
3. **Target audience** — Who is your ideal reader?
4. **Series concept** — Describe the overall idea in 3–5 sentences. What's the big story you're telling across all 3 books?

## Story Foundation

5. **Main character(s)** — Who is the protagonist? Brief description of who they are and what they want.
6. **Central conflict** — What is the core problem or struggle that drives the series?
7. **Setting** — Where and when does the story take place? (e.g., modern-day New York, a medieval fantasy kingdom, a space station in 2350)
8. **Ending direction** — Do you have a sense of how the series ends? Even a vague idea helps. (e.g., "the hero defeats the empire," "she finds peace," "open-ended")

## Existing Material

9. **Have you written any of these books yet?** If so, which ones and how far along are they?
10. **Do you have any outlines, notes, or ideas already?** Feel free to attach anything — even rough notes are helpful.
11. **Are there any plot points or scenes you're committed to?** (Things that MUST happen in the series)

## Tone & Influences

12. **Comparable books or series** — What published series is yours most similar to? (e.g., "like The Hunger Games but set in ancient Rome")
13. **Pacing preference** — Fast and action-packed, slow-burn and character-driven, or a mix?

## Publishing Plans

14. **How will these be published?** (Self-published on Amazon, traditional publishing, other?)
15. **Target book length** — Any word count targets per book? (e.g., 60,000–80,000 words)
