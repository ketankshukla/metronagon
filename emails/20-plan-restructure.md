# Series Plan — Restructure ($175)

**Subject:** Your Series Restructure — Tell Me What's Changing

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your order! I'll have your restructured series plan ready within **3 business days**.

Restructuring can mean a lot of things, so please reply with the following:

1. **Series name** and **current number of books**
2. **Attach your existing series plan** (or reference your original order)
3. **What needs to change?** Check all that apply:
   - [ ] Reorder books (change the sequence)
   - [ ] Split a book into two (too much story for one book)
   - [ ] Merge two books into one (not enough story for separate books)
   - [ ] Add a new book into the existing sequence
   - [ ] Remove a book from the plan
   - [ ] Change the ending or overall arc direction
   - [ ] Rework a major subplot or character arc
   - [ ] Other (describe below)
4. **Why the change?** — Understanding the motivation helps me restructure intelligently. (e.g., "Book 3 is too bloated," "I realized the villain's reveal should happen earlier," "My beta readers said the pacing drags in the middle")
5. **What must stay the same?** — Any plot points, character arcs, or structural elements that are locked in and shouldn't change?
6. **New direction or constraints** — Anything else I should know about what you want the restructured plan to accomplish?
