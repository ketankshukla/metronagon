# Series Expansion Retainer ($350/quarter)

**Subject:** Your Series Expansion Retainer Is Active — Here's How It Works

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for subscribing to the Series Expansion Retainer! Your quarterly retainer is now active.

Here's how it works:

## What's Included

- **Up to 1 new ebook cover per month** (up to 3 per quarter) matching your existing series style
- Each cover is delivered within **2 business days** of your request
- All covers maintain perfect visual consistency with your series branding

## How to Request a Cover

Whenever you're ready for a new cover, simply reply to this email (or email me directly) with:

1. **Book title** (and subtitle, if any)
2. **Book number in the series** (e.g., "Book 7")
3. **Brief description** (2–3 sentences — what happens in this book?)
4. **Key visual element or scene** — What should this cover convey?
5. **Any style evolution notes** — Should this cover shift in any way from the previous ones? (e.g., darker tone, different season, escalating intensity)

That's it. I have your series style system on file, so I'll match everything automatically.

## Billing

- You'll be charged **$350 every 3 months** automatically
- You can cancel anytime from your Stripe customer portal or by emailing me
- Unused months do not roll over — if you don't request a cover in a given month, that slot is simply not used

## Your Series Files

I keep your series style guide, prompt parameters, and all previous covers on file for the duration of your retainer. This ensures every new cover is perfectly consistent, even months apart.

Looking forward to growing your series with you. Send me your first cover request whenever you're ready!

Best,
