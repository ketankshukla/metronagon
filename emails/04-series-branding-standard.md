**Subject:** Your Series Branding Package — Let's Get Started!

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your order! I'm excited to build the complete visual identity for your 5-book series.

To get started, I need a few details from you. Please reply to this email with the following:

## Series Overview

1. **Series name** (if you have one)
2. **Genre** (e.g., thriller, romance, sci-fi, fantasy, literary fiction, etc.)
3. **Brief series description** (3–4 sentences about the overall story arc or theme)
4. **Target audience** — Who is your ideal reader?

## Individual Book Details

For each of the **5 books**, please provide:

5. **Book title** (and subtitle, if any)
6. **Brief description** (2–3 sentences — what happens in this book specifically?)
7. **Key visual element or scene** — What should this particular cover convey?

## Visual Direction (Applies to All 5 Covers)

8. **Mood/tone** — What feeling should the series evoke? (e.g., dark and intense, warm and hopeful, mysterious, epic)
9. **Color palette preferences** — Any colors you love or want to avoid? All 5 covers will share a unified palette.
10. **Style preference** — Photorealistic or stylized?
11. **Key recurring visual element** — Is there an object, symbol, or motif that ties the series together? (e.g., a compass, a crown, a specific landscape)

## Reference Covers

12. **3–5 existing book covers or series you admire** — Especially series with consistent branding across multiple books. Links or titles are fine.

## Logo

13. **Series logo direction** — Any ideas for the logo? (e.g., text-only wordmark, an icon/symbol, a combination) If you're not sure, I'll design something based on the series theme — just say "your call."

## YouTube Thumbnail

14. **Thumbnail purpose** — What will the YouTube thumbnail be used for? (e.g., book launch video, series trailer, author channel) Any specific text or tagline you want on it?

## Typography & Author Name

15. **Author name** (exactly as it should appear on all covers)
16. **Font style preference** — Or "your call" if you'd like me to choose.

## Publishing Platform

17. **Where will this be published?** (Amazon KDP, IngramSpark, other?)

Here's what happens next:

1. I review your brief and design the series style system (shared colors, typography, composition rules)
2. You receive all **5 covers + series logo + box set cover + YouTube thumbnail** within **5 business days**
3. You also receive a **comprehensive style guide PDF** documenting the complete visual system
4. Final files delivered via Google Drive or ZIP

If you have any questions, just reply to this email.
