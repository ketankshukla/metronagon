# Children's Book — Page Edits ($25/page)

**Subject:** Your Page Edits — Which Pages Need Changes?

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your order! I'll get your page edits turned around at **1 day per page**.

Please reply with the following:

1. **Book title** this is for
2. **Which pages need editing?** (List the page numbers)
3. **For each page, describe the change:**
   - **Text changes** — New wording, corrected text, different phrasing?
   - **Illustration changes** — What needs to change in the image? (e.g., "character should be smiling instead of frowning," "change the background from day to night," "add a dog in the corner")
   - **Layout changes** — Text repositioning, different text/image balance?
4. **Attach the current book PDF** (or reference your original order)
5. **Any new reference images?** If you want the illustration to look a specific way, a reference helps.

I'll re-illustrate each edited page to match the existing style and deliver updated files within **1 day per page**.

Best,
