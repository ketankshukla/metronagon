Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your order! I'll have your new box set or panoramic cover ready within **2 business days**.

Please reply with the following:

1. **Series name** and **which books are included** in this box set (e.g., "Books 1–3" or "The Complete Series")
2. **Box set title** — Is it different from the series name? (e.g., "The Aztec Series: Complete Collection")
3. **Attach your existing series covers** so I can create a cohesive composite (or reference your original order)
4. **Format needed:**
   - **Box set cover** (landscape composite for Amazon box set listing)
   - **Panoramic cover** (wide-format scene for banners, marketing, or print posters)
   - **Both?**
5. **Any specific text on the box set?** (e.g., "Books 1–3," "The Complete Trilogy," a tagline)
6. **Author name** (confirm it's the same as your series covers)
7. **Publishing platform** — Where will this be listed? (Amazon KDP, other?)
