# Series Architecture — Large / 8+ Books ($800)

**Subject:** Your Epic Series Architecture Plan — Let's Get Started!

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your order! Building an 8+ book series is a serious undertaking, and I'm going to make sure you have a rock-solid architectural foundation before you write a single chapter.

To get started, I need a few details from you. Please reply to this email with the following:

## Series Overview

1. **Series name** (if you have one)
2. **Genre** (e.g., thriller, romance, sci-fi, fantasy, literary fiction, etc.)
3. **Target audience** — Who is your ideal reader?
4. **Total number of books planned** — Is it exactly 8, or could it be 10, 12, or more?
5. **Series concept** — Describe the overall idea in 5–8 sentences. What's the epic story you're telling?

## Story Foundation

6. **Main character(s)** — Who is the protagonist (or ensemble)? Descriptions of who they are, what they want, and their core internal conflict.
7. **Central conflict** — What is the overarching problem or struggle that spans the entire series?
8. **Setting** — Where and when does the story take place? Include all world-building details you have: magic systems, technology, political structures, geography, religions, factions, etc.
9. **Major turning points** — Do you have ideas for any pivotal moments? (e.g., "book 4 is when the protagonist switches sides," "book 6 reveals the true villain")
10. **Ending direction** — How does the series conclude? Even a vague sense is helpful.

## Existing Material

11. **Have you written any of these books yet?** If so, which ones and how far along?
12. **Do you have any outlines, notes, character sheets, or world-building docs?** Please attach everything you have — the more raw material, the better the architecture.
13. **Are there any plot points, scenes, or reveals you're committed to?**
14. **Secondary characters** — Any important supporting characters you already know you want?
15. **Subplots** — Any storylines beyond the main arc you want woven in?

## Tone & Influences

16. **Comparable books or series** — What published series is yours most similar to? List 2–3 if possible.
17. **Pacing preference** — Fast and action-packed, slow-burn and character-driven, or varying across the series?
18. **Emotional tone** — Dark and gritty, hopeful and uplifting, morally complex, humorous, etc.?
19. **Themes** — What ideas or messages do you want the series to explore? (e.g., power and corruption, found family, redemption, the cost of ambition)

## Multi-Arc Structure

20. **Do you envision sub-arcs?** (e.g., books 1–3 are "the origin arc," books 4–6 are "the war arc," books 7–8 are "the resolution arc")
21. **Multiple POV characters?** If so, who are they and when do they enter the story?
22. **Mystery/revelation layers** — Are there long-term mysteries or secrets that get revealed across the series?

## Publishing Plans

23. **How will these be published?** (Self-published on Amazon, traditional publishing, other?)
24. **Target book length** — Any word count targets per book?
25. **Release cadence** — How often do you plan to release?
