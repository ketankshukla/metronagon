**Subject:** Your New Series Cover — Let's Match the Style

---

Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your order! I'll create a new ebook cover that matches your existing series style. Ready within **2 business days**.

Please reply with the following:

1. **Series name** and **which book number** this new cover is for
2. **Book title** (and subtitle, if any)
3. **Brief description** (2–3 sentences — what happens in this book?)
4. **Key visual element or scene** — What should this specific cover convey?
5. **Attach your existing series covers** so I can match the style exactly (or reference your original order if I still have the files)
6. **Author name** (confirm it's the same as previous covers)
7. **Any style evolution?** Should this cover be identical in style to previous ones, or do you want any subtle progression? (e.g., darker tone, different time of day, seasonal shift)
8. **Publishing platform** — Same as before, or different?

I'll deliver the new cover within **2 business days**, visually matched to your existing series.

Best,
