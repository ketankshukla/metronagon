Hi [Client Name],

Thank you for your order! I'm excited to bring your children's book to life.

To get started, I need a few details from you. Please reply to this email with the following:

## Story Details

1. **Do you have a story written already?** If yes, please attach it. If not, I'll write one based on your concept — just provide the details below.
2. **Book concept** — What is the story about? (3–5 sentences describing the idea, the main character, and the lesson or adventure)
3. **Target age group** — (e.g., 2–4, 4–6, 6–8)
4. **Main character(s)** — Name, age, appearance (hair color, skin tone, clothing, any distinguishing features). The more specific you are, the more consistent the character will be across all 32 pages.
5. **Supporting characters** — Any other characters who appear? Brief descriptions.
6. **Setting** — Where does the story take place? (e.g., a magical forest, a neighborhood, a school, outer space)
7. **Tone** — Fun and silly, gentle and calming, adventurous, educational, etc.?
8. **Lesson or message** — Is there a moral, lesson, or theme? (e.g., kindness, bravery, sharing, being different is okay)

## Visual Direction

9. **Art style preference** — Pixar/Disney-inspired (3D-ish, warm, cinematic), watercolor (soft, dreamy), flat illustration (bold, graphic), or other? If you're not sure, I'll default to a warm Pixar-inspired style — just say "your call."
10. **Color palette** — Bright and colorful, soft pastels, warm earth tones, or specific colors you love?
11. **Reference books or art** — Any existing children's books whose illustration style you admire? (e.g., "I love the look of The Very Hungry Caterpillar" or "Something like Pixar's style")

## Text & Layout

12. **How much text per page?** — Children's books typically have 1–3 sentences per page. Do you have a preference?
13. **Any pages with no text?** — Some pages work better as full-bleed illustrations with no words.

## Dedication & Special Pages

14. **Dedication page text** — (e.g., "For my little adventurer, Emma")
15. **Any special requests?** — Hidden details, inside jokes, a specific scene you've always imagined, etc.

## Publishing Platform

16. **Where will this be published?** (Amazon KDP, IngramSpark, print-on-demand, personal copies only?)
17. **Trim size preference** — Standard is 8.5" × 8.5" square. Any other preference?

3. All **32 pages are illustrated** in a consistent style
4. You receive the **assembled PDF + individual page files** within **5 business days**
