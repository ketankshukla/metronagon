# Metronagon — Starter Business Document

## The Name

**Metronagon** is a combination of two ancient Greek words:

- **Metron** (μέτρον) — meaning "measure," "standard," "the right proportion"
- **Agon** (ἀγών) — meaning "contest," "struggle," "the pursuit of excellence"

Together: **The Measure of Excellence.** A business that delivers work to the highest standard, forged through mastery and relentless quality.

### Delivery Timeline Philosophy

Delivery timelines are deliberately set to signal quality, not speed. Even though the AI-powered pipeline can produce most assets in hours, the stated delivery windows allow for:

- **Multiple generation passes** — never accepting the first output; iterating for the best result
- **Quality review cycles** — stepping away and reviewing with fresh eyes before final delivery
- **Thoughtful refinement** — typography, color correction, and composition polish take time to get right
- **Client communication** — time for questions, clarifications, and brief adjustments
- **Buffer for complexity** — some projects have unique requirements that need extra attention

The Rush Fee (48hr Turnaround) exists for clients who genuinely need speed. Standard timelines exist to protect quality.

```

### Design Direction

- **Dark theme** — consistent with your portfolio style and signature aesthetic
- **Premium feel** — generous whitespace, large typography, subtle animations
- **Gold/amber accent color** — conveys premium quality, pairs with dark backgrounds
- **No stock photos** — use YOUR actual book covers, character portraits, and series branding as proof
- **Mobile-first responsive** — clean on all devices

### Modifications Needed to Current Portfolio (ketanshukla.com)

Your personal portfolio at ketanshukla.com will link TO Metronagon as your services business. The modifications are minimal:

1. **Add a "Services" or "Hire Me" link** in the ketanshukla.com navigation that points to metronagon.com
2. **Add a banner or section** on the homepage: "Need this for YOUR book series? → Visit Metronagon"
3. **Each series page** (Aztec, Repetition, Reality) gets a small CTA: "Want covers and branding like this? → metronagon.com/services"
4. **About page** mentions Metronagon as your creative services business
5. **No structural changes** — ketanshukla.com stays as your author portfolio. Metronagon is the business site.

The two sites work together: ketanshukla.com is the PROOF, metronagon.com is the OFFER.

## Stripe Setup & Integration — Complete Guide

This section covers everything needed to accept payments on the Metronagon website: creating a Stripe account, configuring products, generating payment links, and integrating them into the Next.js site.

### Step 1: Create a Stripe Account

1. Go to [https://dashboard.stripe.com/register](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
2. Enter your email, full name, and a strong password
3. Verify your email address via the confirmation link Stripe sends
4. You'll land on the Stripe Dashboard — this is your payment control center

### Step 2: Activate Your Account (Required Before Live Payments)

Stripe requires identity and business verification before you can accept real money. From the Dashboard:

1. Click **"Activate your account"** (banner at the top) or go to **Settings → Account details**
2. Fill in the following:
   - **Business type:** Individual / Sole proprietor (unless you've formed an LLC)
   - **Legal business name:** Metronagon Media (or your legal name if sole proprietor)
   - **Business address:** Your home address is fine
   - **Industry:** "Design services" or "Creative services"
   - **Business website:** `https://metronagon.com` (add this once your domain is connected)
   - **Product description:** "Professional book cover design, series branding, and illustration services for authors and publishers"
3. Add your **bank account** or **debit card** for payouts
   - Stripe deposits your earnings into this account
   - Standard payout schedule: **2 business days** after a charge
4. Verify your **identity** (government-issued ID + last 4 of SSN)
5. Once verified, Stripe removes the "activate" banner and you can accept live payments

**Important:** Until activation is complete, you can still use **Test Mode** to set everything up. Toggle between Test/Live mode using the switch in the top-right of the Dashboard.

### Step 3: Create Your Products in Stripe

Each service package becomes a Stripe **Product** with a **Price**. Here's how:

1. Go to **Products** in the left sidebar (or navigate to `https://dashboard.stripe.com/products`)
2. Click **"+ Add product"**
3. For each product, fill in:
   - **Name:** e.g., "Ebook Cover Design — Standard"
   - **Description:** e.g., "Single ebook cover, 1600x2400, 300 DPI. 3 concept variations, 1 final polished cover. Delivered in 2 business days."
   - **Image:** Upload the Metronagon logo (`public/portfolio/logo.png`) as the product image
   - **Pricing:** One-time, fixed price (e.g., $75.00 USD)
4. Click **"Save product"**
5. Repeat for all 27 products from the Product Catalogue tables above

**Recommended product creation order:**

```

### Step 4: Generate Payment Links

Payment Links are the fastest way to accept money without building a custom checkout. Each product gets its own shareable link.

1. Go to **Payment Links** in the left sidebar (or `https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links`)
2. Click **"+ New"**
3. Select the product you want to create a link for
4. Configure:
   - **Quantity:** Let customer adjust = No (fixed at 1)
   - **Allow promotion codes:** Yes (so you can apply the returning client discount)
   - **Collect customer email:** Yes (you need this to deliver the work)
   - **After payment → Confirmation page:** Custom message — e.g., "Thank you! We'll reach out within 24 hours to discuss your project. Check your email for a confirmation receipt."
   - **After payment → Redirect:** Optionally redirect to a "Thank You" page on your site (e.g., `https://metronagon.com/thank-you`)
5. Click **"Create link"**
6. Copy the generated URL — it looks like: `https://buy.stripe.com/abc123xyz`
7. Repeat for every product

**Pro tip:** Name your Payment Links clearly in the Stripe dashboard (e.g., "Ebook Cover — Standard $75") so you can find them quickly.

### Step 5: Create a Stripe Coupon for the Returning Client Discount

1. Go to **Products → Coupons** (or `https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons`)
2. Click **"+ New"**
3. Configure:
   - **Name:** "Returning Client — 10% Off"
   - **Type:** Percentage discount
   - **Percentage off:** 10
   - **Duration:** Once (applies to a single payment)
   - **Redemption limits:** No limit (any returning client can use it)
4. Click **"Create coupon"**
5. Copy the **promo code** — share this with returning clients via email

### Step 6: Integrate Payment Links into the Metronagon Website

This is the simplest integration approach — no Stripe SDK, no API keys, no backend code. Each "Buy Now" or "Get Started" button on the `/services` page links directly to the Stripe Payment Link URL.

#### 6a. Store Payment Links in Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root (`e:\metronagon\.env.local`):

```env

```

**Important:** Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore` (it should already be there by default in Next.js). Never commit payment links to Git — they can be used by anyone.

#### 6b. Add Environment Variables to Vercel

Since deployment happens via GitHub → Vercel, you also need to add these env vars in Vercel:

1. Go to [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com) → Your Metronagon project → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add each `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_*` variable with the corresponding Payment Link URL
3. Set the environment to **Production** (and optionally Preview)
4. Click **Save**
5. Redeploy the site (Vercel will pick up the new variables on next deploy)

#### 6c. Wire Up the "Buy Now" Buttons in Code

In `src/app/services/page.tsx`, each `PackageCard` component's CTA button should link to the corresponding Payment Link:

```tsx
// Example: Adding a Buy Now button to the PackageCard
<a
  href={pkg.stripeLink || "#"}
  target="_blank"
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  className="mt-6 block w-full rounded-lg bg-gold px-4 py-3 text-center text-sm font-semibold text-background transition-all hover:bg-gold-light hover:shadow-lg hover:shadow-gold/20"
>
  Get Started — {pkg.price}
</a>
```

Each package in the data arrays would include a `stripeLink` field:

```tsx
{
  name: "Standard",
  price: "$75",
  delivery: "2 business days",
  stripeLink: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_COVER_STANDARD,
  // ... rest of package data
}
```

### Step 7: Set Up Email Notifications

Stripe sends automatic receipt emails to customers. To customize these:

1. Go to **Settings → Emails** (or `https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails`)
2. Enable **"Successful payments"** — sends a receipt to the customer automatically
3. Enable **"Payment refunds"** — sends a notice if you ever refund
4. Customize the **receipt email** — add your Metronagon logo and a message like:
   > "Thank you for your order! We'll be in touch within 24 hours to discuss your project details. If you have any questions, reply to this email."

You should also set up **email notifications to yourself**:

1. Go to **Settings → Team and security → Notification preferences**
2. Enable notifications for:
   - **Successful payments** — so you know the instant someone pays
   - **Disputes** — critical to respond quickly if someone files a chargeback
   - **Payouts** — to track when money hits your bank

### Step 8: Set Up Your Payout Schedule

1. Go to **Settings → Payouts** (or `https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts`)
2. Default is **automatic, daily (2-day rolling)** — money from Monday's sales arrives Wednesday
3. You can change to **weekly** or **monthly** if you prefer larger lump sums
4. Minimum payout threshold: $0.01 (Stripe doesn't hold money)

### Step 9: Test the Full Flow

Before going live, test everything end-to-end:

1. Toggle to **Test Mode** in the Stripe Dashboard (switch in the top-right corner)
2. Create test Payment Links (they'll have test URLs)
3. Use Stripe's test card numbers:
   - **Successful payment:** `4242 4242 4242 4242` (any future expiry, any CVC, any ZIP)
   - **Declined payment:** `4000 0000 0000 0002`
   - **3D Secure required:** `4000 0025 0000 3155`
4. Place a test order through the site
5. Verify:
   - ✅ Payment appears in Stripe Dashboard → Payments
   - ✅ Customer receives a receipt email
   - ✅ You receive a notification email
   - ✅ The confirmation/redirect page works correctly
6. Once satisfied, switch to **Live Mode** and replace test Payment Links with live ones in your `.env.local` and Vercel environment variables

### Step 10: Going Live Checklist

- [ ] Stripe account fully activated (identity verified, bank account connected)
- [ ] All 27 products created in Stripe (Live Mode)
