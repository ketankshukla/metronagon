# Metronagon — Starter Business Document

## The Name

**Metronagon** is a combination of two ancient Greek words:

- **Metron** (μέτρον) — meaning "measure," "standard," "the right proportion"
- **Agon** (ἀγών) — meaning "contest," "struggle," "the pursuit of excellence"

Together: **The Measure of Excellence.** A business that delivers work to the highest standard, forged through mastery and relentless quality.

### Delivery Timeline Philosophy

Delivery timelines are deliberately set to signal quality, not speed. Even though the AI-powered pipeline can produce most assets in hours, the stated delivery windows allow for:

- **Multiple generation passes** — never accepting the first output; iterating for the best result
- **Quality review cycles** — stepping away and reviewing with fresh eyes before final delivery
- **Thoughtful refinement** — typography, color correction, and composition polish take time to get right
- **Client communication** — time for questions, clarifications, and brief adjustments
- **Buffer for complexity** — some projects have unique requirements that need extra attention

The Rush Fee (48hr Turnaround) exists for clients who genuinely need speed. Standard timelines exist to protect quality.

### Design Direction

- **Dark theme** — consistent with your portfolio style and signature aesthetic

- **Gold/amber accent color** — conveys premium quality, pairs with dark backgrounds
- **No stock photos** — use YOUR actual book covers, character portraits, and series branding as proof
- **Mobile-first responsive** — clean on all devices

### Modifications Needed to Current Portfolio (ketanshukla.com)

Your personal portfolio at ketanshukla.com will link TO Metronagon as your services business. The modifications are minimal:

1. **Add a "Services" or "Hire Me" link** in the ketanshukla.com navigation that points to metronagon.com
2. **Add a banner or section** on the homepage: "Need this for YOUR book series? → Visit Metronagon"
3. **Each series page** (Aztec, Repetition, Reality) gets a small CTA: "Want covers and branding like this? → metronagon.com/services"
4. **About page** mentions Metronagon as your creative services business
5. **No structural changes** — ketanshukla.com stays as your author portfolio. Metronagon is the business site.

The two sites work together: ketanshukla.com is the PROOF, metronagon.com is the OFFER.

## Logo Prompt for Metronagon

Use the following prompt with gpt-image-1 (or gpt-image-1.5) to generate the Metronagon logo:

```
Create a premium, modern logo for "Metronagon" — a creative services company specializing in book cover design, series branding, and children's book illustration.

The name combines "Metron" (Greek: measure, standard, the right proportion) and "Agon" (Greek: contest, the pursuit of excellence). The logo should evoke mastery, precision, and creative excellence.

Design requirements:
- The word "METRONAGON" in elegant, premium serif or geometric sans-serif typography
- A logomark/icon that abstracts the concept of measurement meets creative excellence — consider: a stylized compass, a golden ratio spiral, an angular geometric shape suggesting both precision and artistry, or an abstract polygonal form (referencing the "-agon" suffix meaning angles/sides)
- Color palette: deep black background with gold/amber metallic accent (#D4AF37 or similar warm gold)
- Clean, minimal, high-end aesthetic — think luxury brand meets creative studio
- No gradients, no shadows, no 3D effects — flat, sharp, confident
- The logomark should work at small sizes (favicon) and large sizes (hero banner)
- Include a subtle tagline underneath: "The Measure of Excellence"
- Resolution: 3000x1000 pixels, transparent background (or deep black #0A0A0A)
- Style: premium, architectural, confident, timeless — NOT playful, NOT cartoonish, NOT generic
```
