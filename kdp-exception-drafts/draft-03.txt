Subject: Re: Title Creation Limit Exception Request

Dear Jayasudha,

Thank you for your message. Here are the details you requested.

REASON
I am an independent author-publisher with a completed catalogue of 22
original books across three series, all ready for publication. I am
also actively producing new titles as part of a long-term effort to
build a credible, professional publishing presence on KDP. The current
weekly limit restricts my ability to grow that catalogue at the pace
my work requires.

VOLUME AND CADENCE
22 titles ready to publish now, with further titles in active development:
- Aztec Samurai Adventures — 12 books (epic fantasy fiction)
- Reality Without Belief — 5 books (philosophical non-fiction)
- Repetition: Mother of Mastery — 5 books (self-improvement non-fiction)

I am requesting an elevated weekly limit to support ongoing publishing
activity, not a single upload event.

QUALITY CONTROLS
- Original manuscripts written entirely by me — no AI-generated content
- Covers at 1600x2400, 300 DPI, KDP-compliant
- Interiors formatted to KDP Print and Kindle standards
- Unique metadata written individually for each title

CONTENT TYPE
Original fiction and non-fiction across three distinct genres, fully
compliant with all KDP content guidelines.

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT
In addition to my own publishing, I run Metronagon Media — a professional
book cover design and series branding service for other indie authors and
publishers. Building my own catalogue with high-quality covers and series
branding serves a dual purpose: it demonstrates to prospective clients
that I can execute the full publishing pipeline myself, at a professional
standard, from manuscript to finished product. The ability to publish my
own work efficiently is directly tied to the credibility of that business.

I would be glad to share samples or additional materials if helpful.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
