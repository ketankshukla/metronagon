Subject: Re: Title Creation Limit Exception Request

Dear Jayasudha and the KDP Team,

Thank you for your response. I am happy to provide the details requested.

REASON FOR EXCEPTION
I am an independent author-publisher with three completed book series —
22 titles in total — ready for publication. I am also actively developing
further series as part of building a professional publishing catalogue.
The current 10-title-per-week limit significantly slows my ability to
bring completed, quality work to market in a timely manner.

NUMBER OF BOOKS AND CADENCE
22 completed titles across three series, with more in development:
- Aztec Samurai Adventures: 12 books (epic fantasy fiction)
- Reality Without Belief: 5 books (philosophical non-fiction)
- Repetition: Mother of Mastery: 5 books (self-improvement non-fiction)

I am requesting an elevated limit that allows me to publish at a pace
consistent with my output as a serious, full-time indie publisher.

QUALITY CONTROLS
- All manuscripts are original, full-length works written entirely by me
- Covers produced to KDP specifications (1600x2400, 300 DPI)
- Interiors formatted to KDP Print and Kindle standards
- Metadata individually researched and written for each title
- No AI-generated, duplicated, or spun content

TYPE OF CONTENT
Original fiction and non-fiction: epic fantasy, philosophical essays,
and self-improvement — all fully compliant with KDP content guidelines.

I am happy to provide manuscript samples or cover files on request.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Ketan Shukla
