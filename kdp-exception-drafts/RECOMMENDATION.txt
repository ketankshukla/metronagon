KDP EXCEPTION DRAFTS — RECOMMENDATION
======================================

DRAFT 03 — RECOMMENDED

Reasons:
- Tightest structure: each section is 2-4 lines, no padding
- "Ongoing publishing activity, not a single upload event" is the
  clearest signal that you want a permanent elevated limit without
  asking for one explicitly
- Firm but not aggressive — respectful tone throughout
- Includes both contact points (ketanshukla.com + email)
- Short enough that a support agent reads the whole thing

RUNNER-UP: DRAFT 01
Good if you want slightly more detail in the quality controls section
without adding length elsewhere.

AVOID: DRAFT 04
Slightly too formal ("publishing programme", "pleased to provide") —
reads a little stiff compared to the others.

SUMMARY OF DIFFERENCES
-----------------------
Draft 01 — Clean, structured, moderate length. Good all-rounder.
Draft 02 — Slightly more business-forward. Good if you want to
           emphasise the professional/commercial angle.
Draft 03 — Most concise. Best balance of firmness and brevity. RECOMMENDED.
Draft 04 — Most formal. Thorough but slightly over-written.
Draft 05 — Shortest of all. Works if you want absolute minimum words,
           but loses some persuasive detail.
