Subject: Re: Title Creation Limit Exception Request

Dear Jayasudha,

Thank you for your response. I am pleased to provide the information
you have requested.

REASON FOR EXCEPTION
I am a dedicated independent author-publisher committed to building a
substantial, high-quality catalogue on KDP. I have 22 completed titles
ready for publication across three original series, and I am continuously
producing new work. The 10-title-per-week limit creates a meaningful
obstacle to growing my catalogue at the pace that my publishing activity
requires.

VOLUME AND CADENCE
Current completed titles: 22, across three series:
- Aztec Samurai Adventures: 12 books (epic fantasy fiction)
- Reality Without Belief: 5 books (philosophical non-fiction)
- Repetition: Mother of Mastery: 5 books (self-improvement non-fiction)

Additional titles are in active development. I am requesting an elevated
limit to support my ongoing publishing programme, not a temporary upload.

QUALITY CONTROLS
- All content is original, written entirely by me
- Professional cover design to KDP specifications (1600x2400, 300 DPI)
- Interiors formatted to KDP Print and Kindle standards
- Individually crafted metadata for every title
- No AI-generated, duplicated, or low-quality content of any kind

TYPE OF CONTENT
Original long-form fiction and non-fiction across three genres, all
fully compliant with KDP content guidelines. My author portfolio and
series websites are available for review at ketanshukla.com.

I am happy to supply manuscript samples, cover files, or any other
materials that would support your decision. I appreciate your time.

Kind regards,
Ketan Shukla
Independent Author-Publisher
