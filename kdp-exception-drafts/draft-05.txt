Subject: Re: Title Creation Limit Exception Request

Dear Jayasudha,

Thank you for your time. Here are the details requested.

REASON
I am a full-time independent author-publisher with 22 completed original
titles ready for KDP publication and more in active development. My goal
is to build a serious, growing catalogue across multiple series and genres.
The current weekly limit is a significant constraint on that growth.

VOLUME AND CADENCE
22 titles ready now across three completed series, with further titles
in development. I am requesting an ongoing elevated limit — not a
single-event exception — to support a publishing programme that will
continue to grow.

QUALITY CONTROLS
- 100% original content, written entirely by me
- KDP-compliant covers (1600x2400, 300 DPI)
- Properly formatted interiors for Kindle and KDP Print
- Unique metadata per title — no duplication

CONTENT
Epic fantasy fiction, philosophical non-fiction, and self-improvement
non-fiction. All titles comply fully with KDP content guidelines.

Kind regards,
