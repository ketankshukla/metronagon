Subject: Re: Title Creation Limit Exception Request

Dear Jayasudha and the KDP Team,

Thank you for following up. Please find the requested details below.

REASON FOR EXCEPTION
I am a full-time independent author-publisher building a professional
catalogue of original books across multiple genres and series. I currently
have 22 completed titles ready to publish and am actively writing more.
The 10-title-per-week limit creates a bottleneck that prevents me from
publishing at the pace my work demands.

NUMBER OF BOOKS AND CADENCE
22 completed titles ready now, with additional titles in development:
- Aztec Samurai Adventures: 12-book epic fantasy series
- Reality Without Belief: 5-book philosophical non-fiction series
- Repetition: Mother of Mastery: 5-book self-improvement series

I am requesting an increased limit to support ongoing catalogue growth,
not just a one-time upload.

QUALITY CONTROLS
Every title meets the following standards before submission:
- Original, full-length manuscript written entirely by me
- Professional cover design at KDP-compliant specifications
- Interior formatted to KDP Print and Kindle requirements
- Individual metadata (description, keywords, categories) per title
- Zero AI-generated, duplicated, or low-quality content

TYPE OF CONTENT
All titles are original long-form works — fiction and non-fiction —
fully compliant with KDP content policies.
