---

A beautiful, sinuous book cover rendered in the Art Nouveau poster style of 1890s Paris — the flowing, organic, decorative design tradition where every line curves, every border is a living vine, and every figure is framed by ornamental organic forms. The style merges illustration and decoration into a single unified design where the figure, the border, and the text are all part of one flowing composition. The result is an image that is simultaneously a mystery cover and a decorative art object.

THE CENTRAL FIGURE — THE WIDOW (center, 20-80% from top):

A woman in full Victorian mourning dress, rendered in the flat, decorative, stylized manner of Art Nouveau illustration. She stands facing slightly right in three-quarter view, her body forming an elegant S-curve — the characteristic Art Nouveau contrapposto where the figure's posture follows the same organic, flowing lines as the decorative borders.

FACE: Rendered in the Art Nouveau style — idealized, with large, heavy-lidded eyes outlined in dark flowing lines, a small mouth, a pale, oval face framed by flowing dark hair. The expression is enigmatic — grief, or the performance of grief? The face is pale (#E8D8C8) with minimal modeling, defined primarily by strong, flowing outline.

MOURNING DRESS: A full black mourning gown of the 1890s — high collar, fitted bodice, full skirt that pools at the floor. The black (#0A0A0A) dress is the cover's darkest element. The fabric is decorated with jet beadwork — small, glinting black beads (suggested by tiny highlight dots) along the bodice and at the cuffs. A long black veil extends from a small hat, flowing behind and around her, its translucent fabric rendered as fine, flowing black lines that merge with the decorative border — the veil BECOMES the border, the figure BECOMES the decoration.

MOURNING ACCESSORIES: A black-bordered handkerchief in one gloved hand. In the other hand, held at waist level, a SMALL DAGGER — concealed by the fall of the veil, visible only on close inspection. The dagger is slender, ornate, with a jeweled hilt in deep garnet (#6A1A1A). This hidden weapon is the cover's narrative secret — the widow is not merely grieving.

THE ART NOUVEAU BORDER:

Surrounding the figure, an elaborate ornamental border composed of flowing organic forms — the signature element of Art Nouveau design:

The border is built from INTERTWINING VINES and FLOWERS that flow from the bottom of the image upward along both sides, arching over the top to create a complete frame. The vines are sinuous, with the characteristic Art Nouveau whiplash curves — lines that flow in long, sweeping S-curves and sudden, tight spirals. The vine stems are rendered in dark olive (#3A4A28) with leaves in muted sage (#6A7A5A).

FLOWERS: Woven through the vine border, stylized flowers in muted jewel tones:
- DARK ROSES in deep garnet (#6A1A1A) — the color of dried blood, matching the hidden dagger's hilt
- WHITE LILIES in cream (#F0E8D0) — the funeral flower, their trumpet shapes opening outward
- PURPLE IRISES in muted violet (#5A3A6A) — their blade-shaped leaves adding vertical emphasis

The border is not separate from the figure — the widow's veil flows INTO the vine border on the left side, becoming part of the decorative frame. One vine tendril reaches across the bottom of the image and curls around the hem of her dress. This integration of figure and decoration is the essence of Art Nouveau design.

THE BACKGROUND:

Behind the figure and within the vine border, a flat, muted background — not a detailed scene but a simplified, decorative representation:
- The upper background is a pale, warm cream (#FFF0D8) — the color of the printing paper showing through
- A simplified suggestion of Parisian rooftops in flat, dark grey-blue (#3A4050) along the lower background — geometric shapes with mansard roof angles, placed low and small to frame the figure's silhouette
- A stylized crescent moon in pale gold (#D4A860) in the upper-left corner within the border

COLOR PALETTE — ART NOUVEAU MUTED JEWELS:

- Cream paper: #FFF0D8 — background, lightest tone
- Black: #0A0A0A — mourning dress, darkest tone
- Deep garnet: #6A1A1A — roses, dagger hilt, accent
- Dark olive: #3A4A28 — vine stems, border structure
- Sage green: #6A7A5A — leaves
- Muted violet: #5A3A6A — irises, shadow accents
- Pale gold: #D4A860 — moon, metallic accents
- Flesh pale: #E8D8C8 — face, hands
- Paris grey-blue: #3A4050 — rooftop silhouettes
The palette is deliberately MUTED — Art Nouveau poster art typically used a limited palette of muted, sophisticated tones rather than vivid colors. The restraint creates elegance.

LINE QUALITY:

The defining characteristic of Art Nouveau: ALL lines in the image flow with organic, sinuous curves. The outline around the figure is a single, confident, varying-weight line that swells and thins as it follows the form — thick at the shoulder, thin at the waist, thick again at the hip. The vine border lines have the same varying quality. No straight lines exist in the illustration — even the background rooftops have softened corners. The line weight varies from hairline (vine tendrils, veil edges) to bold (figure outline, major vine stems).

TEXT — ART NOUVEAU LETTERING:

Title (positioned at 5-20% from top, integrated into the upper vine border):
"THE WIDOW" — in Art Nouveau display lettering — custom-designed letterforms where each letter has the characteristic flowing, organic quality of Art Nouveau typography: elongated ascenders, sinuous curves, decorative terminals that echo the vine forms. The letters are in deep garnet (#6A1A1A), and small vine tendrils grow from the letter terminals, connecting the text to the border.
"of RUE MORGUE" — on the next line, same Art Nouveau lettering style, slightly smaller, in dark olive (#3A4A28). The reference to Poe's famous detective story is deliberate — this mystery pays homage to the genre's origins.

Subtitle (positioned at 22% from top): "A Parisian Mystery" — in smaller, simpler Art Nouveau lettering in muted violet (#5A3A6A).

Author name (positioned at 85-88% from top, integrated into the lower vine border): "MADELEINE DUVAL-OKAFOR" — in Art Nouveau capitals in pale gold (#D4A860), the letters woven among the lower vine stems.

OVERALL MOOD:

Elegant, mournful, secretive — the feeling of 1890s Paris at its most beautiful and most dangerous, where beauty conceals violence and mourning dress conceals intent. The Art Nouveau style transforms a mystery cover into a decorative art object — something that could hang in a gallery or be framed as a poster. The hidden dagger is the design's dark heart — invisible at first glance, unforgettable once discovered.

THIS IS ART NOUVEAU POSTER ILLUSTRATION. Flowing organic lines, decorative vine borders, muted jewel tones, integrated figure-and-ornament composition. The beauty is in the flow — every line curves, every element connects, and the figure and the frame are one continuous design.
