---

A clever, graphically bold book cover designed as a CROSSWORD PUZZLE — the entire cover surface is filled with a crossword grid, complete with numbered squares, black blocking squares, and clues. The grid is not decorative — it is a real, solvable crossword where the answers relate to murder, clues, and the mystery's themes. The design mimics the look of a newspaper crossword page: newsprint paper texture, the characteristic typeface of newspaper puzzles, and the black-and-white grid that millions of people recognize from their morning paper. One square — just one — is filled in blood-red instead of standard black, the killer's calling card.

THE CROSSWORD GRID (filling 20-80% of the image):

A standard American-style crossword puzzle grid — 15 squares across, approximately 21 squares tall (adjusted to fit the portrait format). The grid follows standard crossword construction rules: bilateral symmetry in the black-square pattern, no unchecked squares (every letter is part of both an across and a down answer), and standard numbering in the upper-left corner of each answer's first square.

BLACK SQUARES: Standard crossword blocking squares in solid black (#1A1A1A), arranged in the characteristic symmetric pattern. Approximately 20% of squares are black.

WHITE SQUARES: Empty squares in white (#FFFFFF) with thin grey (#808080) grid lines separating them. Each square is a precise rectangle.

FILLED SQUARES: Some squares have been filled in with penciled letters — capital letters in a handwritten style (graphite pencil, slightly grey #404040, with the characteristic slight unevenness of pencil on newsprint). The filled letters spell out THEMED ANSWERS across the grid:

ACROSS answers partially filled in:
- 17-Across: "MURDER" (six letters, fully filled)
- 23-Across: "ALIBI" (five letters, fully filled)
- 38-Across: "POISON" (six letters, fully filled)
- 51-Across: "SUSPECT" (seven letters, fully filled)
- 62-Across: "MOTIVE" (six letters, partially filled — "MOTI_E" with the V missing)

DOWN answers partially filled in:
- 3-Down: "VICTIM" (six letters, fully filled)
- 12-Down: "WEAPON" (six letters, fully filled)
- 29-Down: "CLUE" (four letters, fully filled)

The partially completed state suggests a solver in progress — someone working through the puzzle, getting closer to the answer.

THE RED SQUARE:

One square in the grid — at the intersection of a key across and down answer, approximately at the center of the grid — is filled not with black but with VIVID BLOOD RED (#CC1A1A). The red square is the ONLY color in the entire cover. It is the killer's signature — a single square that changes the puzzle from entertainment to evidence. The red is solid and vivid, impossible to miss against the black-and-white grid.

THE CLUES (above and below the grid):

ABOVE THE GRID (8-18% from top): Selected ACROSS clues printed in the standard crossword clue format — numbered, with the clue text in small serif font:
- "17-Across: What happened in the library at midnight (6)"
- "23-Across: She said she was at the theatre. Was she? (5)"
- "38-Across: The method was elegant. The result was not. (6)"
- "51-Across: Everyone is one, until the evidence says otherwise (7)"

BELOW THE GRID (82-90% from top): Selected DOWN clues:
- "3-Down: The first. Not the last. (6)"
- "12-Down: Every killer needs one. So does every crossword. (6)"
- "29-Down: The detective finds them. The killer leaves them. (4)"

The clues are written with double meaning — they function as real crossword clues AND as ominous narrative hints.

NEWSPAPER TEXTURE AND AGING:

The entire cover has the texture and quality of NEWSPRINT:
- PAPER TEXTURE: Visible fiber texture of newspaper paper — slightly rough, slightly grey-white rather than bright white
- NEWSPRINT TONE: The paper is not pure white but the characteristic warm grey (#F0ECE0) of newsprint
- FOLD LINES: Two horizontal fold lines cross the grid — subtle creases suggesting the newspaper has been folded (as it would be in a reader's hands or a detective's evidence bag)
- INK QUALITY: The black squares and printed text have the slightly soft edges of newspaper offset printing — not laser-sharp but with the characteristic mild ink spread of newsprint
- A COFFEE RING STAIN: In the upper-right corner, a circular brown stain (#B09870) from a coffee mug — the universal sign of a puzzle worked over breakfast

PENCIL MARKS:

The filled-in letters are in PENCIL, not pen:
- Graphite grey (#404040) with slight variation in darkness (harder pressing = darker)
- The handwriting is neat but human — consistent letterforms with natural variation
- One letter has been ERASED and rewritten — a faint ghost of the wrong letter visible beneath the correct one, with eraser smudge marks
- A small penciled note in the margin: "Check 38-A??" — the solver's uncertainty

COLOR PALETTE — NEWSPAPER:

- Newsprint off-white: #F0ECE0
- Grid line grey: #808080
- Black squares/text: #1A1A1A
- Pencil graphite: #404040
- Coffee stain: #B09870
- THE RED SQUARE: #CC1A1A — the only color

TEXT — NEWSPAPER AND PUZZLE:

Title (positioned at 2-7% from top, in a newspaper header format):
"THE CROSSWORD KILLER" — rendered as a NEWSPAPER HEADLINE — bold, condensed serif font (think Times New Roman Bold or a newspaper display face) in black (#1A1A1A). Large, spanning the full width, with the characteristic typographic weight of a front-page headline. The title IS the newspaper's headline — integrated into the newspaper page design.

Below the headline, a thin horizontal rule, then: "A Puzzle Mystery" — in smaller serif italic, formatted as a newspaper subheadline.

Author name (positioned at 92-95% from top, below the clues): "by EDGAR CROSS-OKAFOR" — in small serif, formatted as a newspaper byline: "By Edgar Cross-Okafor, Special Correspondent"

OVERALL MOOD:

Clever, cerebral, sinisterly playful — the feeling of solving a crossword puzzle and realizing that the clues are not wordplay but evidence, and the solution is not a phrase but a name. The crossword format is both familiar (everyone has done a crossword) and transformed (this crossword is a crime scene). The single red square is the visual hook — a tiny splash of blood in an ocean of black and white logic.

THIS IS CROSSWORD PUZZLE AS BOOK COVER. Newsprint texture, penciled letters, numbered clues. The beauty is in the cleverness — a format everyone recognizes, weaponized into a mystery.
