DIMENSIONS: 1024 x 1536 pixels, sRGB color profile
GENRE: Children's Chapter Book / Humor (ages 6-9)
ART STYLE: Retro cartoon illustration in the style of 1950s-60s animated cartoons — bold black outlines, flat bright colors, exaggerated rubbery character proportions, and the cheerful, slightly manic energy of classic Saturday morning cartoons.

---

A zany, energetic children's book cover rendered in the bold, clean style of classic mid-century cartoon animation — thick black outlines, flat saturated colors, exaggerated proportions, and the kind of manic, rubbery character design that made golden-age cartoons irresistible. Every character has noodle-like limbs, oversized expressions, and the ability to stretch and squash in ways that defy anatomy. The style is deliberately retro — it references the optimistic, goofy space-age cartoons of the late 1950s and early 1960s, where space travel was fun, aliens were friendly, and everything could be solved with enthusiasm and a ray gun that went "PEW PEW."

THE SCENE — A CHAOTIC CRASH-LANDING ON A PLANET MADE OF SOCKS:

The cover depicts the moment of arrival: a small, cartoonish rocket ship has crash-landed (nose-first, tail sticking up at an angle) on the surface of a planet that is entirely, unmistakably, made of socks. The landscape is sock-terrain, the sky is sock-colored, and loose socks float through the atmosphere like tumbleweeds.

CAPTAIN STARDUST (center-left, 30-75% from top):

A small, enthusiastic child character — gender-ambiguous, approximately 8 years old — standing triumphantly on the sock-landscape with hands on hips in the classic hero pose. Captain Stardust is rendered in the retro cartoon style:
- HEAD: Oversized relative to body (approximately 1/3 of total height), perfectly round, with ENORMOUS eyes (each eye a large white oval taking up 1/4 of the face, with a small black dot pupil and thick black outline). The expression is pure excited glee — a massive open-mouth grin showing a row of simple white teeth.
- BODY: Small and compact with rubbery, noodle-like arms and legs that curve and bend with cartoonish flexibility. Wearing a retro space suit: a bright orange (#FF8030) jumpsuit with a circular glass helmet (the classic fishbowl astronaut helmet), white gloves, and white moon boots with thick soles. A utility belt with oversized, silly gadgets (a rubber duck, a magnifying glass, a sandwich — all clipped to the belt as "essential equipment"). A flowing red cape (#E02020) billows behind, too long for the character, dragging on the ground.
- The helmet has a small antenna on top with a blinking star — a simple five-pointed star shape that alternates yellow and white, suggesting it is flashing.

THE SOCK PLANET SURFACE:

The ground is literally made of socks — a hilly terrain constructed from thousands of mismatched socks in every color, pattern, and size imaginable:
- Striped socks in red and white
- Polka-dot socks in blue with yellow dots
- Argyle socks in green and purple
- Tiny baby socks in pink
- One enormous athletic sock forming a hill
- Socks with holes in the toes, socks with stretched elastic, socks that have clearly been through many wash cycles
The socks are piled and overlapping, creating an uneven, lumpy terrain. Each sock is drawn with a thick black outline and flat color fill in the cartoon style. The variety of patterns and colors creates a chaotic, visually busy ground that is funny in its absurdity.

SOCK ALIENS (scattered around the scene):

Three or four SOCK PUPPET ALIENS — creatures that look exactly like hand-made sock puppets brought to life:
- SOCK ALIEN 1: A tall, thin creature made from a single long green-striped sock, with button eyes (literally — two round button shapes sewn on), a red felt tongue hanging out, and yarn hair on top. It waves at Captain Stardust with its sock-arm (the toe-end of the sock, bending like a hand puppet's mouth).
- SOCK ALIEN 2: A round, short creature made from a fuzzy purple sock, with googly eyes (the kind that rattle — rendered as white circles with black dots that are NOT centered, suggesting they are loose and wobbly). It holds a tiny sock flag — a toothpick with a miniature sock on top.
- SOCK ALIEN 3: Peeking out from behind the crashed rocket, a shy creature made from a pink polka-dot sock, only its button eyes visible.
The sock aliens are friendly, curious, and silly — they are clearly delighted by their visitor.

THE ROCKET SHIP:

A classic retro cartoon rocket — the simple, iconic shape: a tall cylinder with a pointed nose cone, three stabilizer fins at the base, and a round porthole window. The rocket is bright red (#E02020) with silver (#C0C0C0) fins and a yellow (#FFD040) nose cone. It has crash-landed at a 45-degree angle, nose buried in a pile of socks, tail pointing skyward. Small puffs of cartoon smoke (simple white cloud shapes with black outlines) rise from around the crash site. The porthole window has a small crack (a single zigzag line) — a visual gag suggesting the landing was not smooth. "S.S. STARDUST" is painted on the side in wobbly yellow letters.

THE SKY:

A bright, cheerful sky in vivid turquoise (#40D0D0) — flat, no gradients, pure cartoon color. Floating through the sky: individual loose socks drifting like clouds (three or four scattered socks in different colors and patterns, each with a black outline, tumbling through the air). Stars are simple white four-pointed shapes scattered across the turquoise. A nearby planet is visible in the upper corner — a ringed planet (like Saturn) but the rings are made of orbiting socks.

CARTOON TECHNIQUE:

- THICK BLACK OUTLINES: Every single element has a bold black outline (#000000), consistent width (approximately 2-3px at scale), with smooth curves. The outlines are the visual backbone of the image.
- FLAT COLORS: No gradients, no shading, no texture within any color area. Every surface is a single, solid, flat color. Shadows are depicted as separate flat color areas (slightly darker versions of the base color) with their own black outlines — NOT as gradients.
- EXAGGERATED PROPORTIONS: Heads are too big, limbs are too thin and bendy, expressions are too wide. Everything is pushed to cartoon extremes.
- CLEAN LINES: No paper texture, no brush marks, no painterly effects. The lines are smooth and clean, as though drawn with a digital pen or animation cel marker.

TEXT — BOLD CARTOON LETTERING:

Title (positioned at 3-22% from top, centered):
"CAPTAIN" — in a bold, slightly rounded cartoon display font (think Bangers or a custom cartoon lettering style) in bright yellow (#FFD040) with a thick black outline around each letter. Large, energetic, slightly tilted (3 degrees clockwise for dynamic energy).
"STARDUST" — on the next line, same font, LARGER, in bold red (#E02020) with thick black outline and a yellow drop-shadow offset to the lower-right. The biggest word on the cover.
"and the Planet of" — on the next line, much smaller, in white with black outline, same font.
"SOCKS" — on the next line, same size as "STARDUST," in bright orange (#FF8030) with black outline. A tiny cartoon sock replaces the dot of the 'S' — wait, there's no dot. Instead, a tiny sock hangs from the 'S' at the end of the word.

Author (positioned at 89-92% from top): "by MILES PEMBERTON-OKAFOR" — in small cartoon font in white with black outline.

OVERALL MOOD:

Silly, energetic, irresistible — the kind of cover that makes a child laugh before they even open the book. The retro cartoon style, the absurd premise (a planet of socks!), and the goofy characters all signal: this book is FUNNY, this book is an ADVENTURE, and this book does NOT take itself seriously.

THIS IS RETRO CARTOON ILLUSTRATION. Bold outlines, flat colors, rubbery proportions, maximum silliness. The beauty is in the energy — every character is in motion, every element is exaggerated, and the entire cover vibrates with the manic joy of a Saturday morning cartoon.
