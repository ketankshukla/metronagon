---

A magical children's book cover rendered entirely as chalk art on a dark chalkboard surface. Every element looks like it was drawn with sticks of colored sidewalk chalk on the rough, dark surface of a classroom blackboard. The chalk technique is authentic: powdery, slightly smudged at the edges, with the characteristic way chalk catches on the high points of a rough surface and skips over the low points, creating a grainy, textured line. The dark chalkboard background shows through everywhere — between chalk strokes, in areas of lighter pressure, and as the dominant dark ground against which the bright chalk colors glow.

THE CHALKBOARD SURFACE:

The background is a dark surface — either classic blackboard black-green (#1A2A1A) or deep slate (#1A1A20). The surface has the characteristic texture of a real chalkboard: very fine, even grain with occasional subtle scratches and the ghost marks of previously erased chalk (faint, hazy areas of lighter tone where chalk dust has been imperfectly erased, suggesting this chalkboard has been drawn on many times before). A thin wooden frame border is visible at the very edges — the warm brown (#6B4A30) of a classroom chalkboard frame.

THE SCENE — A CHALK CITY COMING TO LIFE AT NIGHT:

The drawing depicts a city skyline drawn in chalk — buildings, streets, and vehicles — but the chalk drawings are COMING ALIVE. Some elements are still clearly flat chalk drawings on the board; others have begun to lift off the surface, becoming three-dimensional, stepping out of their drawn outlines.

THE CITY SKYLINE (across the middle, 30-70% from top):

A row of buildings drawn in white and colored chalk — simple, cheerful building shapes:
- A tall apartment building in white chalk outlines with yellow chalk windows (each window a small filled rectangle glowing warmly)
- A church or clock tower with a pointed steeple, drawn in blue chalk with a white chalk clock face
- A row of houses with different colored roofs (red, green, purple chalk)
- A bridge connecting two buildings, drawn in orange chalk with arched supports
The buildings on the LEFT side of the image are still flat — clearly drawn on the chalkboard, with chalk texture and the dark surface visible through the strokes. But moving toward the RIGHT side, the buildings begin to "lift off" — they appear to become three-dimensional, their chalk lines gaining depth and shadow, as though the drawings are peeling away from the chalkboard surface and standing up into real space. The rightmost building has completely stepped off the board — it casts a chalk-dust shadow on the surface behind it.

CHALK CHARACTERS COMING TO LIFE:

Several small stick-figure-style characters (drawn in chalk with the simple charm of a child's drawing) are in various stages of "coming alive":
- A CHALK GIRL (center, drawn in pink and yellow chalk) has one foot still drawn flat on the board and the other lifted up, stepping forward into three-dimensionality. Her chalk-drawn hair appears to flutter. She reaches toward a chalk-drawn butterfly that has fully separated from the board and flies free, trailing chalk dust.
- A CHALK DOG (simple round body, stick legs, wagging tail drawn in brown chalk) has fully come alive and is running across the bottom of the image, leaving a trail of chalk dust paw prints on the dark surface.
- A CHALK CAT sits on a chalk-drawn windowsill, still mostly flat but with its tail curling up off the surface into the third dimension.

CHALK STARS AND MOON (upper portion, 5-30% from top):

Above the city, a night sky drawn in chalk: large five-pointed stars in yellow and white chalk scattered across the dark surface, each star drawn with the bold, simple strokes of chalk on board. A LARGE CRESCENT MOON in bright yellow chalk dominates the upper-left — the moon is one of the elements coming alive: its left edge is still flat chalk on the board, but its right edge curves outward into three-dimensional space, and it is shedding tiny chalk-dust sparkles as it transforms.

CHALK TECHNIQUE:

- POWDERY TEXTURE: All chalk marks have the characteristic powdery, granular quality of real chalk — the pigment sits on the surface rather than soaking in, creating a soft, slightly dusty appearance
- SURFACE SKIP: On lighter strokes, the chalk catches only the high points of the chalkboard texture, creating a broken, grainy line with dark flecks showing through
- SMUDGE ZONES: Areas where the chalk has been smudged by a hand or eraser — soft, blended zones where colors merge and fade, the sharp edge replaced by a soft halo of chalk dust
- CHALK DUST: Visible chalk dust settles at the base of the image (the chalk tray area) — small accumulations of colored powder in white, yellow, pink, and blue, resting on the narrow wooden ledge at the bottom of the chalkboard
- LAYERING: Where colors overlap, the top color partially obscures the bottom color in the characteristic way chalk layers — not transparent like watercolor but semi-opaque, with both colors partially visible
- ERASER MARKS: Ghost images of previously drawn shapes faintly visible in the background — smeared, hazy outlines suggesting that this chalkboard has held many drawings before this one

COLOR PALETTE — CHALK ON DARK:

- White chalk: #E8E8E0 — primary drawing color, outlines
- Yellow chalk: #FFE060 — stars, moon, windows, accents

- Orange chalk: #FF9040 — bridge, warm accents
- Purple chalk: #9060C0 — special accents

All colors have the soft, slightly muted quality of chalk pigment — bright but not sharp, saturated but powdery.

TEXT — WRITTEN IN CHALK:

Title (positioned at 3-18% from top, centered):
"CHALK" — written in large, bold white chalk with heavy pressure — the letters are bright, thick, and slightly uneven, as though drawn by hand with a fat stick of chalk. The word is BIG — filling most of the width.
"WORLD" — on the next line, same bold chalk style, in bright yellow chalk. A small chalk-drawn star sits in the 'O' of WORLD.

Subtitle (positioned at 20% from top, centered): "What Happens When the Playground Sleeps" — in smaller, neater chalk writing in pink chalk, as though a teacher wrote this part.

Author (positioned at 89-92% from top, in the chalk-tray area): "by OWEN BRIGHTWELL-TANAKA" — in small white chalk writing.

OVERALL MOOD:

Magical, imaginative, night-wonder — the feeling of sneaking into a classroom after dark and finding that everything drawn on the chalkboard has come to life. The chalk aesthetic grounds the magic in a familiar childhood setting — every child knows chalkboards, knows the feel of chalk in their hand, knows the satisfaction of drawing on that dark surface. The coming-to-life transformation adds wonder and the suggestion that imagination has real power.

THIS IS CHALK ON BLACKBOARD ART. Powdery, grainy, bright-on-dark. Visible surface texture, chalk dust, smudged edges. The beauty is in the contrast — bright, soft chalk colors glowing against the deep dark surface, and the magical moment when flat drawings begin to breathe.
