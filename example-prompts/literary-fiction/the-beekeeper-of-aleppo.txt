THE BEEKEEPER OF ALEPPO — A NOVEL OF EXILE
TYPE: Paperback Front Cover
DIMENSIONS: 1024 x 1536 pixels, sRGB color profile
GENRE: Literary Fiction / Refugee Experience
ART STYLE: Watercolor wash with ink line — the loose, expressive, slightly unfinished quality of a travel sketchbook watercolor. A scene captured quickly but with emotional precision: a man standing in a field of wildflowers with beehives behind him, the landscape bleeding at the edges into unpainted white paper. The deliberate incompleteness suggests memory — the parts we remember are vivid; the edges dissolve into nothing.

---

A deeply emotional book cover rendered in the style of a watercolor sketchbook painting — loose, expressive, slightly unfinished, with areas of vivid, saturated color dissolving into bare white paper at the edges. The scene depicts a man standing in a field of wildflowers with traditional beehives visible behind him, but the painting is INCOMPLETE — the central figure and immediate surroundings are rendered in full, luminous watercolor, while the edges of the image dissolve into unpainted paper, ink outlines without color fill, and finally nothing. This deliberate incompleteness is the cover's visual metaphor: memory is vivid at its center and dissolves at its borders; exile means carrying a landscape that is no longer whole.

THE PAINTED CENTER (approximately 25-75% from top, 15-85% from sides):

The vivid, fully-rendered heart of the painting:

THE MAN: A figure standing in a field, seen from behind — we see his back, his shoulders, the back of his head. He looks out across the landscape. He is rendered in confident watercolor: a dark jacket in deep indigo-blue (#1A3A5A) watercolor wash, warm brown skin on the back of his neck and hands (#B08060), dark hair. The figure is NOT photorealistic — it is painted with the quick, expressive economy of a skilled watercolorist: a few confident strokes define the jacket's folds, a single wash establishes the skin tone, the hair is a single dark stroke. The figure is specific but not detailed — a real person captured in the shorthand of watercolor.

THE WILDFLOWERS: The field around the figure is alive with flowers — painted in loose, wet-on-wet watercolor: bright poppies in vivid red (#CC2020), yellow wildflowers in warm cadmium (#FFD040), blue cornflowers in cerulean (#2080C0), and the green of grass and stems in varied washes (#4A8A40 to #80A060). The flowers are NOT individually rendered — they are suggested by splashes, dots, and small strokes of pure color dropped into wet green washes, bleeding and blooming in the characteristic way watercolor spreads on wet paper. The effect is a field that shimmers with color.

THE BEEHIVES: Behind the figure, three or four traditional clay beehives — the cylindrical, stacked-stone hives used in Syria for thousands of years. They are rendered in warm earth tones (#B09060 to #8B6B40) with confident line-and-wash technique: ink outlines providing structure, watercolor washes providing warmth and weight. Bees are suggested by tiny dark dots and dashes around the hive entrances.

THE SKY: Above the field, a watercolor sky — a graded wash from warm blue (#4080B0) at the top to warm golden (#FFE8C0) near the horizon. The sky wash is executed in a single, confident passage — visible watercolor tide marks where the wet edge moved across the paper, the characteristic evidence of a wash applied quickly and confidently.

THE DISSOLVING EDGES (surrounding the painted center):

The painting's most powerful visual element — the way the vivid center dissolves into nothing:

TRANSITION ZONE: Moving outward from the painted center, the watercolor becomes progressively LESS complete:
- First, the color washes thin out — becoming lighter, more transparent, showing more paper through the pigment
- Then, color disappears entirely, leaving only the ink LINE DRAWING beneath — the skeleton of the scene without its color flesh. The ink lines show what the painting COULD have depicted: more flowers, distant hills, perhaps buildings or trees, but rendered only as thin pen outlines on white paper
- Finally, even the ink lines stop — trailing off into nothing, the last line fading as the pen was lifted from the paper

The transition is not symmetrical — it is organic and uneven, as memory is. Some areas dissolve quickly (the left side, perhaps, where the city would have been — too painful to paint). Other areas extend further (the field of flowers, the beloved landscape, held in memory longer). The result is an irregular, organic shape of painting floating on white paper.

THE WHITE PAPER (the outer frame):

The unpainted areas show clean, bright white watercolor paper (#FFFFFF) — the heavy, textured surface of quality watercolor paper with visible grain. The white is not empty — it is the material reality of the paper, the physical ground on which the memory-painting exists. The white says: this is where memory ends, this is where the painting could not continue, this is the absence that surrounds what remains.

WATERCOLOR TECHNIQUE:

- WET-ON-WET: Areas where wet paint was applied to wet paper, creating soft, bleeding edges and beautiful color mixing (the flower field, the sky wash)
- WET-ON-DRY: Areas where wet paint was applied to dry paper, creating sharper edges and more defined shapes (the figure, the hives)
- INK LINE: Fine pen-and-ink drawing visible beneath and beyond the watercolor — providing structure in the painted areas and standing alone in the unpainted edges
- PAINT DROPS AND SPLASHES: Small, uncontrolled marks where paint dripped or splashed — the evidence of speed, emotion, a painting made urgently
- PALETTE MIXING MARKS: A small smudge of mixed color in the lower margin — as though the artist tested a color on the paper's edge before applying it to the painting

COLOR PALETTE — WATERCOLOR PIGMENTS:

- Indigo blue: #1A3A5A — figure's jacket
- Poppy red: #CC2020 — field flowers
- Cadmium yellow: #FFD040 — wildflowers
- Cerulean blue: #2080C0 — cornflowers, sky
- Green varied: #4A8A40 to #80A060 — grass, stems
- Skin warm: #B08060 — figure
- Earth warm: #B09060 — beehives
- Sky blue: #4080B0 — upper sky
- Golden horizon: #FFE8C0 — lower sky
- Ink line: #1A1A1A — structural drawing
- Paper white: #FFFFFF — unpainted areas

TEXT — HANDWRITTEN QUALITY:

Title (positioned at 5-18% from top, in the white paper area above the painted scene):
"THE BEEKEEPER" — in a warm, slightly irregular serif (think a font with hand-drawn qualities, like Sorts Mill Goudy or similar) in indigo blue (#1A3A5A) — matching the figure's jacket color. The text has the slightly warm, slightly imperfect quality of a title written on a watercolor painting. Medium-large.
"of ALEPPO" — on the next line, same font, in poppy red (#CC2020) — the most vivid color in the painting, the color of memory's brightest flowers.

Subtitle (positioned at 20% from top): "A Novel of Exile" — in small, thin serif in warm earth (#8B6B40), letter-spacing 0.15em.

Author name (positioned at 85-88% from top, in the white paper area below the painted scene): "NADIA KHOURY-OKAFOR" — in serif in indigo blue (#1A3A5A), letter-spacing 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Bittersweet, vivid-then-dissolving, achingly beautiful — the feeling of remembering a landscape you can never return to, where the center of the memory is still bright with color but the edges have already begun to dissolve into white absence. The unfinished watercolor technique makes the painting feel FRAGILE — as though it could continue dissolving, as though the vivid center might eventually fade too, as though memory itself is a painting that water is slowly washing away.

THIS IS UNFINISHED WATERCOLOR ON WHITE PAPER. Vivid color dissolving into ink line dissolving into nothing. The beauty is in the incompleteness — what is painted glows with life; what is left unpainted speaks of loss.
