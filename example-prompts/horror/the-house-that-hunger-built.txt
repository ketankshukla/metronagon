THE HOUSE THAT HUNGER BUILT — A FOLK HORROR NOVEL
TYPE: Paperback Front Cover
DIMENSIONS: 1024 x 1536 pixels, sRGB color profile
GENRE: Folk Horror / Rural Horror
ART STYLE: Woodcut print in the tradition of medieval and early modern European woodblock printing — bold, stark, black-on-white imagery with the characteristic rough texture of carved wood grain showing through the printed areas.

---

A stark, powerful book cover rendered as a traditional woodcut print — the oldest form of European printed illustration, where an image is carved in reverse into a block of wood, inked, and pressed onto paper. The visual language of woodcut is bold, graphic, and inherently unsettling: thick black lines, stark contrast between inked and uninked areas, the visible texture of wood grain in the printed surfaces, and the characteristic roughness of hand-carved lines that are never perfectly smooth. This is horror art from a tradition that predates photography by centuries — and it remains terrifying.

THE WOODCUT IMAGE — A HOUSE IN A DEAD FIELD:

The image depicts a single farmhouse standing in an empty agricultural field — but both the house and the field are WRONG in ways that become increasingly disturbing on examination.

THE HOUSE (center, 25-65% from top):

A simple two-story farmhouse rendered in bold woodcut lines — the kind of rural house found in any agricultural region: a rectangular body, a pitched roof, a front door, windows, a chimney. But carved with subtle wrongness:

- The house is slightly ASYMMETRICAL — not enough to be immediately obvious, but enough to create unease. The left side is slightly taller than the right, as though the house has grown unevenly. The roofline is not straight but gently curved, bowing upward at the center like something breathing in.
- The WINDOWS are rendered as deep black rectangles (areas where the wood was carved away completely, leaving pure ink). Within each window, fine carved lines suggest shapes behind the glass — but the shapes are wrong. In one window, the shape could be a curtain or a hand pressed against the glass. In another, a face-like oval tilts at an angle no comfortable person would hold.
- The DOOR is open — a deep black rectangle that reads as a mouth. The doorframe is carved with slightly organic curves that suggest teeth or ribs rather than architectural framing. The darkness within the door is absolute — the deepest black in the image.
- The CHIMNEY emits not smoke but what appears to be hair — long, flowing lines rising from the chimney that could be smoke rendered in the woodcut style but that, on close inspection, have the individual strand quality of human hair. The hair-smoke rises and spreads across the sky.

THE FIELD:

The house stands in a field that extends to all edges of the image — a flat, agricultural space rendered in the woodcut convention for plowed earth: parallel curved lines (furrow rows) running from the foreground to the horizon. But the furrows are not straight — they curve and converge on the house from all directions, as though the field is being pulled toward the building. The furrow lines closest to the house are deeper, wider, more aggressive — the earth appears to be opening, the furrows becoming trenches, then crevasses.

In the field, barely visible amid the furrow lines, small details emerge: a partially buried shoe, a hand emerging from the earth palm-up, a face-down figure half-covered by turned soil. These are rendered with the same matter-of-fact woodcut precision as the furrows themselves — they are simply part of the landscape, as natural as the soil.

THE SKY:

Above the house, the sky is rendered in the woodcut convention for clouds: dense, swirling, carved patterns of black and white that suggest storm clouds. The clouds spiral inward toward the chimney's hair-smoke, creating a vortex above the house. A pale circle suggests a sun or moon — but it has a carved spiral pattern within it that reads more as an eye than a celestial body. The sky occupies the top 25% of the image and is heavily carved — predominantly dark, with white cloud-edges created by the uninked areas between carved lines.

A line of CROWS sits along the peak of the roof — small, black, angular bird shapes carved in the bold, simplified style of medieval woodcut animals. They face outward in both directions, sentinels.

WOODCUT TECHNIQUE:

- BOLD BLACK LINES: All outlines and major forms are rendered in thick black lines — the characteristic weight of hand-carved woodcut where the knife removes material on both sides of each line
- WOOD GRAIN TEXTURE: In the large black areas (the door, the windows, the darkest sky areas), the texture of wood grain is faintly visible — the parallel lines of the original wood surface that the ink picks up when pressed, creating a subtle, organic texture within the flat black
- HATCHING: Tonal gradation is achieved through parallel carved lines of varying density — widely spaced lines for lighter areas, closely packed lines for darker areas. The hatching follows the forms: curved lines on the roof, vertical lines on the walls, horizontal lines on the field
- ROUGH EDGES: Carved lines are not perfectly smooth — they have the slight irregularity of a hand guiding a knife through wood, with tiny variations in width and direction. This roughness is the woodcut's character.
- HIGH CONTRAST: There are no true mid-tones — only black (inked) and white (paper). All apparent greys are created by hatching density

COLOR PALETTE — WOODCUT MINIMAL:

- Printing ink black: #0A0A08 (slightly warm black, not blue-black)
- Unbleached paper: #F0E8D0 (warm cream, the color of traditional printing paper)
NO other colors. The power of woodcut is in its absolute reduction to two tones.

TEXT — CARVED INTO THE BLOCK:

Title (positioned at 5-18% from top, centered within the dark sky):
"THE HOUSE THAT" — in a bold, slightly irregular serif font that appears to have been CARVED alongside the image — the letters share the woodcut's character: slightly rough edges, visible carved-line texture within the letterforms, the weight and boldness of text cut into wood. White (paper) letters reversed out of the black (ink) sky area. Medium-large.
"HUNGER BUILT" — on the next line, same carved-woodcut style, LARGER. The words "HUNGER BUILT" are the heaviest text, their carved letters deep and commanding.

Subtitle (positioned at 20% from top): "A Folk Horror Novel" — in smaller carved text, reversed out of the dark sky, slightly rougher and less precise than the title.

Author name (positioned at 88-92% from top, in the dark lower field): "AGNES BLACKTHORN-OSEI" — carved in small, precise text reversed from a dark furrow band.

OVERALL MOOD:

Ancient, rural, inevitable — the feeling of discovering a place in the landscape that has been hungry for a very long time and has learned patience. The woodcut aesthetic connects this horror to the oldest traditions of European image-making — Dürer's apocalyptic prints, Holbein's Dance of Death, the broadsides and chapbooks that spread tales of rural terror before electricity existed. The medium itself says: this horror is OLD.

THIS IS WOODCUT PRINT ART. Bold black ink on cream paper. Carved lines, wood grain texture, stark two-tone contrast. The beauty is in the reduction — no color, no gradient, no subtlety. Only the stark, graphic power of black line on white paper, depicting a house that should not exist in a field that devours.
