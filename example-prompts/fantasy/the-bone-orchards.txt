---

A haunting book cover rendered entirely in the scratchboard technique — an illustration method where a white clay-coated board is covered in black ink, and the image is created by SCRATCHING away the black to reveal white lines beneath. The result is an image composed entirely of white lines on a black ground — the negative of a pen-and-ink drawing. Every element is built from scratched marks: fine parallel hatching for smooth surfaces, cross-hatching for shadows, stippling for texture, and bold single lines for contours. The black areas are absolute — untouched ink surface. The white areas are never solid white — they are always composed of visible individual scratch marks, giving the entire image a textural, hand-crafted quality.

THE SCENE — A NECROMANCER IN A FOREST OF BONE-WHITE TREES:

A dense, claustrophobic forest fills the image, but these are not living trees — they are trees made of bone. Enormous skeletal forms rise from the ground, their trunks composed of fused vertebrae and long bones, their branches made of ribcages that have opened and extended outward like reaching arms, their canopy a lattice of thin finger bones and teeth arranged in organic branching patterns. Every bone surface is rendered in meticulous scratchboard detail — fine parallel scratch lines following the contours of each bone, creating the characteristic smooth-then-porous texture of actual bone. The marrow cavities of broken bones are visible in cross-section — dark voids within the white bone structure.

THE NECROMANCER (center, 40-75% from top):

A tall, gaunt figure stands among the bone trees — a person of indeterminate age and gender, wrapped in layered robes that are more absence than presence. The robes are rendered as deep black areas with only their edges and folds revealed by fine white scratch lines — the figure is mostly shadow, defined by the light that catches fabric edges. Their face is partially visible within a deep hood — high cheekbones, hollow cheeks, and eyes that are rendered as two points of PALE SPECTRAL GREEN (#70FF90) — the ONLY color in the entire image. These green eyes glow against the monochrome scratchboard, creating an immediate focal point. The green is not a flat fill — it is rendered as a fine network of green-tinted scratch lines radiating outward from the pupil, as though the green light is being etched into the black by the same scratching technique as the rest of the image.

The necromancer's hands are extended outward, bony and long-fingered, and from their fingertips, thin tendrils of the same spectral green light extend outward and downward into the ground — connecting to the root systems of the bone trees, which glow faintly green at their contact points with the earth. The suggestion is clear: the necromancer GREW these trees from the bones of the dead.

THE GROUND — BURIAL EARTH:

The forest floor is rendered in dense cross-hatching — dark, rich, disturbed earth. Partially visible in the soil, rendered in fine scratchboard detail: skull fragments, isolated teeth, small bones, and the edges of buried objects (a sword hilt, a crown, a broken shield). These are the raw materials from which the bone trees grew. Among the surface bones, small mushrooms and fungi grow — their caps rendered in fine stippling, their gills in delicate parallel scratch lines. These are the only organic living things besides the necromancer — death feeders, recyclers, the only life that thrives in a bone orchard.

SCRATCHBOARD TECHNIQUE DETAILS:

The rendering must authentically reproduce scratchboard characteristics:
- All white areas are composed of visible scratch marks — NO solid white fills
- Fine parallel hatching (lines running in one direction) for smooth, lit surfaces
- Cross-hatching (intersecting line sets) for mid-tones and shadows
- Stippling (dots made by the scratch tool tip) for rough textures like earth and bark
- Bold single-line contours defining major shapes
- The black ground is absolute — areas of deepest shadow are simply untouched black ink
- Line weight varies: fine, hair-thin lines for distant detail and delicate textures; bolder, wider scratches for foreground elements and strong contours
- The overall effect is of extraordinary detail emerging from darkness — the image rewards close inspection

COLOR PALETTE — MONOCHROME PLUS ONE:

- Absolute black: #000000 — ink ground, shadows, the dominant tone
- Scratch white: #F0F0E8 — all scratched lines, bone surfaces, highlights
- Spectral green: #70FF90 — ONLY the necromancer's eyes and the magical tendrils/glow points. Used extremely sparingly — perhaps 2% of the total image area. This single color against the monochrome creates maximum impact.

TEXT — ETCHED INTO THE BLACK:

Title (positioned at 5-18% from top, centered):
"THE BONE" — rendered in a serif font that appears to be SCRATCHED into the black surface using the same technique as the illustration — each letter composed of visible parallel scratch lines rather than solid fills. The letters are white scratch-lines on black, matching the illustration aesthetic perfectly. Large, with the characteristic slightly rough edges of scratchboard work.
"ORCHARDS" — on the next line, same technique, same size. The two title lines frame the dark upper canopy of bone branches.

Series line (positioned at 20% from top, centered): "A Necromancer's Chronicle" — in smaller scratched lettering, thinner and more delicate than the title, in the same white-on-black scratchboard style.

Author name (positioned at 90-93% from top, centered): "CORVUS BLACKWOOD-ASANTE" — in small, precise scratched capitals, letter-spacing 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Dark, intricate, mesmerizing — the feeling of peering into a darkness so detailed that the longer you look, the more you see. Scratchboard art has a unique psychological quality: because the image emerges FROM darkness rather than being drawn ON lightness, everything feels like it is being revealed rather than created — as though the bone orchard was always there, hidden in the black, waiting to be uncovered.

At thumbnail, the white bone-tree forms against deep black create a stark, immediately arresting silhouette. The two green eyes are tiny but vivid — they pull the viewer's attention to the center of the darkness. At full resolution, the scratchboard technique reveals extraordinary detail in every inch of the image.

THIS IS SCRATCHBOARD ART. White scratched from black. Every line revealed, not drawn. The beauty is in the emergence of intricate detail from absolute darkness, and the single spectral accent that says: something in this darkness is ALIVE.
