---

A magnificent Art Nouveau book cover illustration rendered entirely in the decorative style of Alphonse Mucha's theatrical posters from the 1890s. This is NOT photorealistic — it is a flat, stylized, richly ornamental illustration with the distinctive characteristics of the Art Nouveau movement: sinuous organic curves, elaborate decorative borders, mosaic-like color blocking, and a harmonious fusion of figure and ornament where the human form becomes part of the decorative pattern. The rendering quality should match the finest modern Art Nouveau revival illustrations — think James Jean meets Mucha, with contemporary color richness applied to the classic Art Nouveau compositional framework. Every line must flow, every shape must curve, every element must feel like it grew organically from the one beside it.

THE BORDER — THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT (IT FRAMES EVERYTHING):

The entire cover is enclosed within an elaborate Art Nouveau decorative border that is integral to the design — not an afterthought, but the architectural framework that everything else exists within. The border is approximately 8% of the image width on each side, 6% at the top, and 5% at the bottom.

The border is constructed from intertwining botanical forms rendered in the Art Nouveau style — sinuous, flowing, impossibly elegant:

TOP BORDER: An arched header panel, curved like the top of a cathedral window, formed by two symmetrical branches of a celestial wisteria vine. The branches rise from each side and meet at the center-top in an elaborate knot. The wisteria clusters hang downward into the title space — painted in cascading gradients of deep amethyst purple, soft lavender, and pale lilac, each individual floret a tiny jewel-like shape. The leaves are rendered in muted sage green with gold vein details. The branches themselves are sinuous dark brown lines with the characteristic Art Nouveau whiplash curve — no straight lines anywhere.

SIDE BORDERS: Continuous flowing vines descend from the top arch, incorporating multiple botanical species that interweave: morning glory vines with trumpet flowers in deep sapphire blue and violet, passion flowers in intricate geometric detail (rendered as natural mandalas — the passion flower's complex structure is perfect for Art Nouveau's love of geometric-organic fusion) in cream white with purple filaments, and trailing jasmine with tiny star-shaped white flowers. The vines are punctuated by Art Nouveau geometric accents — small circular medallions at regular intervals containing tiny symbolic illustrations: a crescent moon, a key, a butterfly, a closed eye, a serpent eating its tail — each rendered in fine line work with jewel-tone fills.

BOTTOM BORDER: The vines converge at the bottom into a base panel featuring a symmetrical design of lotus flowers and lily pads — the lotus rendered in pale pink and cream with gold-tipped petals, floating on a stylized water surface depicted as flowing horizontal lines in teal and deep blue-green. A pair of ornamental koi fish, rendered in the flat decorative Art Nouveau style (not realistic), swim symmetrically beneath the author name — one in warm coral-gold, the other in cool silver-blue, their flowing tails and fins becoming part of the decorative vine pattern.

BACKGROUND WITHIN THE BORDER:

The background behind the central figure is NOT a realistic landscape — it is a decorative Art Nouveau backdrop rendered as a stylized mosaic of color fields, like a stained-glass window seen from a distance. The upper background (behind the title area) is a gradient field of deep twilight blue transitioning to warm amber-gold at the horizon line — but rendered in the flat, poster-like style of Mucha, with visible delineation between color zones rather than photographic gradation. Stars are depicted as small geometric Art Nouveau star shapes — six-pointed, with radiating line details — scattered across the blue upper field in pale gold. A large crescent moon sits in the upper-left quadrant, rendered in pale cream-gold with a serene face in profile (the "man in the moon" motif, classic to Art Nouveau), surrounded by a halo of radiating gold lines.

The lower background transitions into a stylized garden — not a realistic garden but a decorative pattern of interlocking plant forms in the Art Nouveau style. Towering foxgloves in deep magenta and soft pink, enormous poppies in burnt orange and scarlet, and cascading ferns in emerald green create a dense, tapestry-like field of botanical decoration. Between the plants, glimpses of ancient stone — fragments of classical columns and archways, rendered as flat grey-blue shapes with simple line details suggesting weathered marble. This is the "garden of forgotten gods" — where divine architecture crumbles and nature reclaims everything in luxurious profusion.

THE CENTRAL FIGURES — TWO WOMEN, INTERTWINED WITH THE GARDEN:

This cover features TWO figures, not one — positioned in the center of the image from approximately 40% to 85% from the top, their bodies and clothing flowing into and becoming part of the decorative botanical border.

FIGURE ONE (LEFT): A woman of South Asian descent with warm brown skin, depicted in the flat, idealized Art Nouveau style — not photorealistic, but beautifully stylized with clean lines and decorative detail. She faces right in three-quarter profile, her expression serene and knowing, with large almond-shaped eyes outlined in the characteristic Mucha style (strong outline, flat color fill, minimal modeling). Her eyes are deep brown with gold Art Nouveau star-highlights. Her hair is long, raven-black, elaborately styled in flowing waves that cascade down her left side and transition seamlessly into the vine border — individual strands becoming tendrils that sprout tiny jasmine flowers. Her hair is decorated with a crescent moon hair ornament in pale gold. She wears flowing robes in deep saffron gold and burnt orange, the fabric rendered as flat color fields with elegant fold-lines in darker tone — the drapery follows Art Nouveau's characteristic flowing curves, pooling and swirling around her feet where it merges with the lotus border at the bottom. Her left hand is extended outward, palm up, and from her palm grows a single magnificent passion flower rendered in extraordinary detail — the flower's geometric complexity is the visual centerpiece of the entire figure.

FIGURE TWO (RIGHT): A woman of West African descent with rich dark brown skin, facing left in three-quarter profile — mirroring Figure One in a symmetrical Art Nouveau composition. Her expression is fierce and protective, her jaw set, her gaze direct. Her eyes are dark with amber highlights. Her hair is styled in an elaborate crown of tight coils and braids piled high atop her head, decorated with tiny blue morning glory flowers woven throughout — the braids and flowers rendered in the same flat, decorative Art Nouveau line-work style. Her hair transitions at the edges into the vine border on the right side, becoming part of the ornamental framework. She wears flowing robes in deep sapphire blue and midnight indigo, with silver embroidery patterns rendered as fine white lines in geometric Art Nouveau motifs. Her right hand grips the hilt of a ceremonial sword — the sword's blade is not steel but living crystal, rendered in pale amethyst purple with facet lines, and from the blade's tip, tiny butterflies emerge and flutter upward, transitioning from solid shapes near the blade to decorative border elements as they reach the upper vine work. Her left hand touches Figure One's extended hand — their fingertips meet at the exact center of the image, the passion flower growing from the point of contact.

The two women's robes, hair, and accessories flow into each other and into the border — there is no hard separation between "figure" and "decoration." This is the essence of Art Nouveau design: the human form IS the ornament.

TEXT — DECORATIVE ART NOUVEAU LETTERING, EACH TEXT ELEMENT IN A DIFFERENT STYLE:

Series name (positioned within the top arch of the border, approximately 3-5% from top, curved to follow the arch): "The Celestine Chronicles" — rendered in an elegant Art Nouveau display font with characteristic flowing curves and organic terminals (think Arnold Böcklin font or similar Art Nouveau typeface). The letters are rendered in pale gold (#D4AF37) with a thin dark outline, the text curving to follow the arch of the top border. Small decorative stars flank each end of the text.

Title — two lines (positioned at 8-20% from top, centered within the border frame):
"The Garden of" — rendered in a medium-weight Art Nouveau serif font in deep amethyst purple (#6B3FA0), elegant and flowing, with decorative ligatures connecting the "Th" and the "of."
"Forgotten Gods" — rendered MUCH larger, in an elaborate Art Nouveau display font that is completely different from the line above. This font is heavy, ornamental, with thick strokes that have organic tapering and decorative terminals that curl into tiny leaf and vine shapes. The color is deep teal (#1A6B6B) with a thin gold (#D4AF37) inline (a thin gold line running through the center of each letter stroke, like a vein of gold in stone). The G of "Gods" has an especially elaborate decorative terminal that curls downward and transitions into a small vine illustration.

Subtitle (positioned at 22% from top, centered): "Book One" — in small, refined italic lettering in warm cream (#F5E6C8), flanked by two tiny decorative elements: a stylized key on the left and a stylized butterfly on the right, both rendered in line art with pale gold fill.

Author name (positioned at 91-93% from top, centered, within the lotus border panel): "ANANYA OSEI-MENSAH" — in clean, wide-spaced Art Nouveau capitals in warm cream (#F5E6C8) with subtle gold inner glow. The letters are elegant and refined — Art Nouveau capitals with subtle organic curves on the serifs. Below the name, a tiny decorative colophon: two crossed passion flowers in line art with purple and gold fill.

OVERALL MOOD AND QUALITY:

Lush, mythic, decorative, sacred — the feeling of stepping into a temple where the walls are alive with flowering vines and the gods have been gone so long that nature has made the ruins more beautiful than the original architecture. The palette is jewel-toned — amethyst purple, sapphire blue, saffron gold, emerald green, teal, coral, and cream — the colors of stained glass and illuminated manuscripts. The Art Nouveau style gives the cover a timeless quality — it could have been created in 1898 or 2026. The two women and their intertwined design represent partnership, power, and the sacred feminine — the "romantasy" audience will recognize this as their genre immediately.

At thumbnail size, the ornate border frame, jewel-tone colors, and symmetrical composition are instantly distinctive. At full resolution, the botanical details, the decorative line work, and the flowing integration of figure and ornament are stunning.

THIS IS ART NOUVEAU ILLUSTRATION. Flat, decorative, stylized. NOT photorealistic. NOT 3D rendered. Visible outlines, color blocking, decorative pattern integration, flowing organic curves. Think Mucha's "The Seasons" poster series, not a photograph. The beauty is in the line, the curve, the ornament, and the color harmony.
