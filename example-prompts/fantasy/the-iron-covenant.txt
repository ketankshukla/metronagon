---

A photorealistic urban fantasy book cover that looks like a photograph of magic happening in the real world. The base image has the quality of high-end street photography — gritty, immediate, shot with available light on a wet city street at night. But layered into this photographic reality, supernatural elements exist with complete photographic conviction — glowing ward sigils, crackling energy, and the suggestion that the boundary between the mundane and the magical has broken down on this particular street corner. The magic is NOT stylized or fantastical — it is rendered with the same photographic realism as the puddles and the brick walls. If magic were real, this is what a photograph of it would look like.

THE SETTING — A NARROW CITY ALLEY AT NIGHT, AFTER RAIN:

A tight, claustrophobic alley between old brick buildings — the kind of alley found in any old American or British city. The walls are aged red brick darkened with decades of grime, the mortar crumbling in places. Fire escapes zigzag up the left wall — black iron, rust-spotted, with accumulated debris on the landings. The ground is wet cobblestone — old, uneven, with puddles in every depression reflecting the scene above in dark, distorted mirrors. A single tungsten streetlight mounted on the right wall (approximately 30% from top) provides the primary mundane light source — a warm, yellowish pool of light that illuminates the center of the alley while leaving the edges in deep shadow.

Dumpsters, scattered trash, a bicycle chained to a drainpipe, graffiti on the lower walls — the quotidian details of urban reality rendered with photographic precision. Rain has stopped recently but water still drips from fire escape railings and window ledges, each drip catching the streetlight as a tiny golden flash.

THE MAGICAL ELEMENTS — WARD SIGILS AND ENERGY:

Overlaid on this photographic reality, a complex magical ward system is visible — and it is BREAKING:

WARD SIGILS: On the brick walls of both buildings, large circular sigils are visible — geometric patterns approximately four feet in diameter, drawn in lines of cold blue-white light (#80B0FF) that appear to be burned or etched into the brick surface itself. The sigils are complex: concentric circles containing geometric star patterns, runic script along the inner rings, and radiating lines connecting node points. The sigils glow with a steady, cold light that casts blue highlights on the wet brick around them — competing with the warm tungsten of the streetlight and creating a split-tone lighting effect (warm amber vs. cold blue) across the entire alley. Six sigils are visible — three on each wall, arranged vertically up the alley walls, each one slightly different in its internal geometry.

THE BREAKING WARD: The lowest sigil on the left wall — the one closest to the viewer — is CRACKING. Fine fracture lines of brilliant white light radiate outward from its center like cracks in glass. Where the cracks extend beyond the sigil's circular boundary, the brick wall itself is cracking — actual physical damage to the masonry caused by the failing magical ward. Small pieces of brick dust and mortar float in the air around the cracking sigil, suspended by the escaping energy. The light from this breaking sigil is brighter and more erratic than the stable ones — flickering, pulsing, with occasional bright flashes that cast sharp, momentary shadows.

From the cracks in the breaking ward, tendrils of dark energy — rendered as wisps of blackish-purple smoke or shadow (#1A0030 with slight transparency) — seep outward into the alley. These tendrils are not natural smoke — they move with purpose, curling and reaching, defying air currents. They flow downward and pool on the wet cobblestones, where they create a dark stain that is spreading slowly toward the center of the alley. The puddles near this dark energy reflect it as patches of void — areas in the water reflections that are unnaturally dark, as though the reflection has been erased.

THE FIGURE — A WARDBREAKER AT WORK:

Standing in the center of the alley (approximately 45-75% from top), a person faces the breaking ward with one hand extended, palm outward. They are rendered with photographic realism — a woman in her early 30s of mixed East Asian and Black heritage, wearing practical modern clothing: a worn leather jacket (dark brown, scuffed at the elbows), dark jeans, heavy boots. Her natural hair is pulled back in a practical puff. Her expression is intense concentration mixed with controlled fear — she knows what she's doing, but what she's doing is dangerous. She is lit from both sides: warm amber tungsten from the streetlight (right side) and cold blue ward-light from the sigils (left side), creating a dramatic split-tone portrait.

From her extended palm, a counter-sigil — smaller, hand-scale — blazes in warm amber-gold light (#FFB030), its geometric pattern different from the wall wards. This counter-sigil is her tool, her weapon against the breaking ward. Fine lines of amber energy extend from her palm-sigil to the cracking wall-ward, attempting to seal the fractures. The amber lines of her magic interact with the blue lines of the ward and the dark tendrils of whatever is trying to break through, creating a three-way visual tension: blue (ward), amber (wardbreaker), dark purple (the threat).

COLOR PALETTE — URBAN NIGHT WITH MAGICAL CONTAMINATION:

- Tungsten amber: #FFB060 — streetlight, her counter-sigil, warm side lighting
- Ward blue-white: #80B0FF — stable sigils, cold side lighting
- Breaking white: #FFFFFF — fracture lines, energy flashes
- Dark void purple: #1A0030 — seeping dark energy, the threat
- Wet brick red-brown: #5A2A1A — alley walls, urban texture
- Puddle black: #101018 — wet ground, reflections
- Iron grey: #4A4A4A — fire escapes, dumpsters, urban metal

TEXT — URBAN AND BOLD:

Title (positioned at 5-18% from top, centered over the dark upper alley):
"THE IRON" — in a bold, condensed sans-serif font (think Oswald Bold or Anton — the fonts of urban posters and protest signs) in warm amber (#FFB060). Large, strong, with tight letter-spacing. The warm amber connects to the wardbreaker's magic.
"COVENANT" — on the next line, same font, same size, in cold ward blue (#80B0FF). The amber-to-blue title mirrors the split-tone lighting of the scene.

Series line (positioned at 20% from top, centered): "Book One of the Wardbreaker Saga" — in small sans-serif in white (#E0E0E0), letter-spacing 0.2em.

Author name (positioned at 90-93% from top, centered over the dark cobblestones): "ZARA OKONKWO-CHEN" — in bold condensed sans-serif in white (#E0E0E0), letter-spacing 0.15em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Tense, urban, grounded — the feeling that magic is not beautiful or whimsical but DANGEROUS, messy, and happening in the same alleys where people take out their trash. The photorealistic grounding makes the magical elements genuinely unsettling — they are not fantasy, they are an intrusion of the impossible into the everyday. The split-tone lighting (warm amber vs. cold blue) creates cinematic tension.

At thumbnail, the glowing blue sigils on dark brick walls with the warm-lit figure create an immediately compelling urban fantasy image. At full resolution, the photographic detail of the wet alley and the convincing integration of magical elements are extraordinary.

THIS IS PHOTOREALISTIC URBAN FANTASY. The base is street photography. The magic is composited with photographic conviction. The beauty is in the collision of the mundane and the supernatural — rain puddles reflecting ward sigils, brick walls cracking under magical pressure, a woman in a leather jacket fighting the impossible with geometry and light.
