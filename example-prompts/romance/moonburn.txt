---

A haunting, beautiful book cover created using the double-exposure photography technique — two separate images seamlessly merged into one, where a woman's portrait and a moonlit forest landscape occupy the same space. The effect is dreamlike and liminal: trees grow where her hair should be, the moon glows where her heart is, and the boundary between person and place dissolves. This technique creates images that are simultaneously portrait and landscape, intimate and vast, human and wild.

THE PRIMARY EXPOSURE — THE WOMAN'S PORTRAIT:

The base image is a close-up portrait of a woman, framed from the crown of her head to just below her collarbones, centered in the image. She is shown in three-quarter profile facing slightly right, her eyes closed, her expression one of surrender or transformation — lips slightly parted, head tilted back as though feeling moonlight on her face. Her features are visible but softened by the overlay of the second exposure:

She is a woman of Indigenous American and Irish descent in her late 20s, with warm brown skin, high cheekbones, and dark hair that flows outward and upward from her head (the hair will merge with the tree canopy in the double exposure). Her features are strong and beautiful — the kind of face that suggests wildness barely contained by human form.

Her portrait defines the SHAPE of the overall image — her silhouette becomes the container for the landscape. Where her silhouette ends (the edges of her hair, her shoulders, her profile line), the image fades to the background color. The portrait is not evenly exposed — her face is brighter (more visible) in the center, fading to near-transparency at the edges, allowing the landscape to dominate in the peripheral areas.

THE SECOND EXPOSURE — THE MOONLIT FOREST:

Layered over and through the portrait, a moonlit forest landscape fills her silhouette:

TREES: Tall, bare-branched deciduous trees (birch or aspen) fill the upper portion of the image — their white trunks and dark branches visible THROUGH her face and hair, as though the forest is growing inside her. The trees are sharpest and most visible in the areas where her portrait is most transparent (the edges of her hair, her forehead, her closed eyelids), creating the illusion that her hair IS the tree canopy and her thoughts ARE the forest.

THE MOON: A full moon is positioned precisely where her heart would be — in the center of her chest area, approximately 65% from the top of the image. The moon is the brightest element: a perfect circle of cold silver-white light that glows through her silhouette, visible through the layered portrait as though she has swallowed the moon and it illuminates her from within. The moon casts silver light upward through the trees (which are inside her) and outward through her skin, giving her portrait an ethereal, internal luminescence.

FOREST FLOOR: In the lower portion of her silhouette (below the moon, corresponding to her chest and shoulders), a misty forest floor is visible — dark earth, fallen leaves, and ground mist rendered in silver-blue tones. Through the mist, two amber-gold points of light glow — animal eyes, watching. A wolf? A fox? Something else? The eyes are the only warm color in the second exposure, and they are positioned approximately where her own closed eyes would be if the portrait and landscape perfectly aligned — suggesting that when she closes her human eyes, her animal eyes open.

DOUBLE EXPOSURE BLENDING:

The two images blend according to the rules of photographic double exposure:
- Where BOTH images are bright, the result is very bright (the moon area, where it overlaps her lit face)
- Where one image is dark and the other is bright, the bright image shows through (the tree branches show through the darker areas of her hair)
- The overall effect creates zones of varying transparency: her face is most "solid" at the nose, lips, and cheekbone highlights; the forest is most visible in the shadows of her hair, the dark areas of her closed eyes, and the periphery of her silhouette

This blending creates the cover's magic — the viewer's brain constantly oscillates between seeing a portrait and seeing a landscape, never fully resolving into either.

THE BACKGROUND (outside her silhouette):

The areas outside her silhouette fade to deep midnight blue (#0A0A2A) — a rich, dark background that allows the double-exposure silhouette to float as a self-contained world. The edges of the transition are soft and organic — no hard cutout lines, just a gentle fade from image to darkness.

COLOR PALETTE — MOONLIGHT AND FIRE:

- Silver-blue moonlight: #B0C0D0 — the dominant tone, cold and ethereal
- Deep midnight blue: #0A0A2A — background, deepest shadows
- Moon white: #F0F0FF — the full moon, brightest highlights
- Birch trunk white: #D0C8C0 — tree trunks showing through the portrait
- Branch dark: #1A1A20 — bare branches, the darkest internal elements
- Warm amber eyes: #FFB040 — the animal eyes, the ONLY warm color
- Skin warmth: #C0A090 — her face tones, visible through the overlay
- Mist silver: #808898 — ground mist, atmospheric haze
The palette is 95% cool moonlight tones with the single warm accent of the amber eyes — a color choice that tells the story: something warm and wild lives inside this cold, beautiful exterior.

TEXT — CLEAN AND MOONLIT:

Title (positioned at 5-16% from top, centered over the dark area above her head):
"MOONBURN" — in a single word, rendered in a medium-weight serif font (think Lora or Merriweather — warm, readable serifs) in silver-white (#D0D8E0). Large, letter-spacing 0.15em. The word "MOONBURN" is evocative and genre-signaling — paranormal romance readers recognize moon imagery immediately.

Series line (positioned at 18% from top, centered): "A Shadow Cove Novel" — in small italic serif in a slightly warmer silver (#C0B0A0), letter-spacing 0.15em.

Author name (positioned at 90-93% from top, centered over the dark lower area): "RAVEN BLACKWATER-OSEI" — in serif capitals in silver-white (#D0D8E0), letter-spacing 0.25em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Haunting, sensual, liminal — the feeling of standing at the edge of a forest at night and sensing that the boundary between human and animal, between the tame and the wild, is thinner than anyone admits. The double-exposure technique makes this cover feel like a secret — something glimpsed between blinks, a truth visible only when two realities overlap.

At thumbnail, the woman's silhouette filled with moonlit trees is immediately striking and recognizable as paranormal romance. At full resolution, the subtle blending of portrait and landscape — the branches in her hair, the moon in her chest, the animal eyes behind her closed lids — is extraordinary.

THIS IS DOUBLE-EXPOSURE PHOTOGRAPHY. Two images occupying the same space, creating a third image that is more than either alone. The beauty is in the dissolve — the moment where person becomes place, where the human and the wild share a single frame.
