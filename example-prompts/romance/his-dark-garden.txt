---

A dramatic, high-contrast book cover rendered as fine art black-and-white photography with a single, vivid color accent. The image is almost entirely monochrome — deep blacks, luminous whites, and rich silver greys — with ONE element in vivid, saturated blood-red that draws the eye like a wound. The photographic style is fashion editorial meets film noir: dramatic directional lighting, deep shadows that conceal as much as they reveal, visible film grain that adds texture and mood, and the kind of composed, deliberate beauty that makes the viewer uncomfortable because it is too perfect.

THE IMAGE — A MAN'S HANDS OFFERING A RED ROSE:

The composition is tightly cropped and intimate — showing only a man's hands, forearms, and torso (no face), holding a single red rose toward the viewer. The tight crop creates mystery (who is this person?) and intimacy (the rose is being offered to YOU).

THE HANDS: A man's hands — large, strong, with long fingers and prominent knuckles — extend from the lower-center of the image, cupped gently around a single long-stemmed rose. The hands are rendered in the rich silver-grey tones of fine black-and-white photography: every line, every tendon, every vein is visible in the dramatic side-lighting. The skin tone is luminous medium-grey with bright highlights on the knuckle ridges and deep shadows in the finger valleys. The hands are beautiful but not soft — there is strength in the grip, control in the way the fingers curve around the stem. The right thumb presses against a thorn on the stem — a single drop of blood (rendered in VIVID RED, the only color in the image) wells at the point of contact, catching the light as a tiny crimson jewel.

THE ROSE: A single, perfect, long-stemmed red rose — rendered in FULL, SATURATED COLOR while everything else is monochrome. The rose is the cover's visual heart: its petals are vivid blood-red (#CC1A1A), each petal rendered with photographic precision — the velvet texture of the petal surface, the way the petals curl and overlap, the deep crimson shadows where petals fold inward, the brighter scarlet where light catches the petal edges. The rose is at peak bloom — fully open but not yet dropping petals, at the precise moment of maximum beauty before decay begins. The green stem and leaves are also in color — a deep, rich green (#1A4A1A) that provides a cooler accent to the warm red. The thorns on the stem are sharp and prominent — rendered in precise detail, each one a small, curved spike.

The contrast between the vivid, living color of the rose and the monochrome world around it is the cover's entire visual argument: in a world of grey, this obsession is the only thing that is REAL, the only thing with COLOR, the only thing that MATTERS.

THE TORSO AND ARMS: Behind the hands, the man's torso is partially visible — wearing a dark suit (appearing as near-black in the monochrome rendering) with a white dress shirt (bright, luminous white-grey). The suit is tailored and expensive — visible in the precise cut of the lapel, the crisp fold of the shirt cuff at the wrist. One cufflink catches the light — a small, bright highlight. The torso fades into deep shadow at the edges, the figure emerging from and receding into darkness.

LIGHTING — DRAMATIC AND NOIR:

A single, hard light source from the upper-left creates extreme contrast: the left sides of the hands and the rose are brilliantly lit (bright whites and the full red of the rose); the right sides fall into deep, dramatic shadow (near-black). The shadow of the rose falls across the man's white shirt as a sharp, geometric silhouette — the shadow of the flower drawn in black on white fabric. The lighting is deliberate and theatrical — this is not natural light but the carefully controlled illumination of a photographer's studio, designed to create beauty through contrast.

FILM GRAIN: A visible, fine-grained film texture covers the entire image — the characteristic grain of high-speed black-and-white film (think Kodak Tri-X or Ilford HP5 pushed two stops). The grain is most visible in the mid-tone areas (the skin, the grey shirt) and adds a tactile, analog quality that prevents the image from looking digitally clean. The grain is subtle — felt more than seen — but it adds warmth and authenticity.

COLOR PALETTE — MONOCHROME PLUS RED:

- True black: #0A0A0A — deepest shadows, suit, background void
- Rich silver-grey: #808080 — skin mid-tones, grey fabric
- Luminous white: #E8E8E8 — shirt highlights, brightest skin highlights
- Blood red: #CC1A1A — rose petals, the blood drop (THE ONLY COLOR)
- Deep crimson: #6B0A0A — rose petal shadows
- Forest green: #1A4A1A — rose stem and leaves (secondary color)
- Film grain warm: the grain has a very subtle warm tone, preventing the monochrome from feeling cold

TEXT — STARK, MODERN, HIGH-FASHION:

Title (positioned at 5-18% from top, centered over the dark upper background):
"HIS DARK" — in a bold, condensed sans-serif font (think Bebas Neue or Oswald Bold — the fonts of fashion magazines and film posters) in bright white (#E8E8E8). Large, tight letter-spacing. The bold white against deep black is stark and commanding.
"GARDEN" — on the next line, same font, same size, in blood red (#CC1A1A). The white-to-red title matches the monochrome-to-color transition in the image. The red "GARDEN" echoes the red rose below.

Subtitle (positioned at 20% from top, centered): "a novel of obsession" — in thin, small, widely-spaced sans-serif in medium grey (#808080), all lowercase, letter-spacing 0.4em. Understated, almost clinical — the calm voice describing something dangerous.

Author name (positioned at 90-93% from top, centered): "VALENTINA NOIR-OKAFOR" — in thin sans-serif capitals in medium grey (#808080), letter-spacing 0.3em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Dangerous, seductive, controlled — the feeling of being offered something beautiful by someone whose face you cannot see and whose intentions you cannot read. The monochrome world with the single vivid rose is a visual metaphor for obsessive love: everything else fades to grey when the object of obsession is present. The blood on the thumb says: this beauty has a cost, and someone is already paying it.

At thumbnail, the stark black-and-white composition with the vivid red rose creates instant visual impact — the red pops off the monochrome like a signal flare. At full resolution, the hand detail, the rose petal textures, and the film grain are extraordinary.

THIS IS FINE ART BLACK-AND-WHITE PHOTOGRAPHY with selective color. Dramatic noir lighting, visible film grain, and a single vivid accent. The beauty is in the contrast — between light and shadow, between monochrome and color, between the gentle gesture of offering a flower and the blood on the thorn.
