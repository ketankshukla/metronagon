---

A bold, exciting book cover rendered as a vintage travel poster for a steampunk world — the kind of poster that would hang in an airship terminal advertising passage to exotic destinations, rendered in the clean, flat, geometric style of 1930s Art Deco travel advertising. The poster is bright, optimistic, and adventurous — it sells the romance of airship travel in a world of brass, steam, and impossible machines. The style is deliberately poster-bold: flat colors, strong silhouettes, simplified forms, and text integrated into the graphic composition.

THE AIRSHIP (center, filling 25-70% from top):

A massive steampunk airship dominates the composition — seen from a dramatic low angle, the ship fills the sky above the viewer. The airship is NOT a simple blimp or zeppelin but a fantastical steampunk vessel:

HULL: A massive, elongated oval hull in polished brass (#C8A030) — rendered as a flat, warm gold shape with a subtle rivet pattern (tiny dots in a slightly darker gold). The hull has the characteristic steampunk aesthetic: functional Victorian engineering made beautiful through excessive ornamentation.

GONDOLA: Beneath the hull, a multi-deck gondola structure in dark mahogany (#4A2010) and brass — resembling a Victorian ship's hull suspended beneath the gas envelope. The gondola has rows of portholes (small circles of warm light), open observation decks with tiny silhouette figures visible, and ornamental railings.

PROPULSION: Massive brass propellers (four of them, two on each side) extend from the gondola on articulated arms — the propellers are rendered as bold, geometric, circular shapes with radiating blade lines. Steam plumes trail from exhaust ports along the hull — rendered as flat, white, flowing shapes that curve and spiral in the wind.

FINS AND RUDDERS: At the stern, elaborate brass fins and rudders in the characteristic Victorian ornamental style — scalloped edges, riveted construction, decorative scrollwork rendered as simple line patterns on flat shapes.

A JOLLY ROGER FLAG: Flying from the highest point of the hull — a black flag with a white skull-and-crossgears (a skull with interlocking gear-teeth instead of crossbones). This marks the ship as a SKY PIRATE vessel. The flag is a bold, flat graphic element — black rectangle, white skull, immediately readable.

THE SKY AND CLOUDS:

Behind and around the airship, a dramatic sky rendered in flat poster colors:
- Deep cerulean blue (#1A5A8B) in the upper portions
- Warm amber (#FFD080) near the horizon, suggesting sunset
- Stylized clouds rendered as bold, flat white (#FFFFFF) shapes with smooth, Art Deco curves — not naturalistic clouds but the decorative, swooping cloud forms of travel poster art. The clouds layer behind the airship, creating depth through overlapping flat shapes.

IRON BAY BELOW (bottom 30%):

Below the airship, a bird's-eye view of the destination — Iron Bay — rendered as a simplified, flat poster cityscape:
- A harbor filled with steampunk vessels: ships with smokestacks and paddle wheels, smaller airships docked at mooring towers, a lighthouse with a rotating brass beacon
- The city behind the harbor: Victorian rooftops, factory smokestacks trailing flat white steam plumes, clock towers, and the massive iron framework of what appears to be an airship construction dock
- All rendered in simplified, flat silhouettes — dark warm brown (#3A2010) and charcoal (#2A2A2A) against the amber horizon glow
- The water of the bay is a flat band of deep teal (#0A4A5A) with simple geometric reflections

POSTER DESIGN ELEMENTS:

THE BORDER: A thin geometric Art Deco border in dark brown (#3A2010) frames the entire composition — simple stepped lines with small gear-motif decorations at the corners.

TRAVEL POSTER TEXT INTEGRATION: The title and text are integrated INTO the poster design — they are not overlaid text but part of the original poster composition:

Top banner area (5-12% from top): A warm amber (#FFD080) banner shape containing:
"THE SKY PIRATES" — in bold Art Deco display lettering in dark brown (#3A2010). Large, geometric, with the characteristic decorative terminals of Deco typography.

Below the banner: "of IRON BAY" — in larger, bolder Deco lettering in brass gold (#C8A030) — the largest text on the cover.

Bottom banner area (80-90% from top): A dark brown banner containing:
"DAILY DEPARTURES — ADVENTURE GUARANTEED — ALL CLASSES WELCOME" — in small Deco sans-serif in amber (#FFD080), letter-spacing 0.2em. This faux travel-poster tagline adds to the poster-artifact quality.

Subtitle: "A Steampunk Adventure" — in small text in the border area, in dark brown.

Author: "CAPTAIN JOSEPHINE BRASS-OKAFOR" — in Deco lettering in brass gold, positioned in the lower border area.

OVERALL MOOD:

Adventurous, romantic, inviting — the feeling of standing in a steampunk airship terminal, looking at a poster that promises adventure in a distant port, and deciding to buy a ticket. The travel poster format transforms the adventure genre into aspirational advertising — the reader doesn't just want to READ about sky pirates, they want to BE one.

THIS IS STEAMPUNK TRAVEL POSTER ART. Art Deco geometry, flat limited palette, bold silhouettes, integrated typography. The beauty is in the bold simplicity — a world of brass and steam reduced to seven colors and a promise of adventure.
