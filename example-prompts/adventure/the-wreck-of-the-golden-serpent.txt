THE WRECK OF THE GOLDEN SERPENT — A DIVING ADVENTURE
TYPE: Paperback Front Cover
DIMENSIONS: 1024 x 1536 pixels, sRGB color profile
GENRE: Treasure Hunting Adventure / Maritime
ART STYLE: Split-level ocean photography — the cover split horizontally at the waterline, showing both above and below the surface simultaneously. Above: a dramatic tropical sky and distant island. Below: a sunken shipwreck on the ocean floor with a diver approaching. The characteristic visual of underwater split-shots where the camera is half-submerged, creating two worlds in one frame.

---

A stunning book cover using the split-level underwater photography technique — the camera positioned exactly at the ocean's surface line, capturing BOTH the world above the water and the world below in a single frame. The upper half shows a tropical sky with a distant volcanic island; the lower half reveals a coral-encrusted shipwreck on the sandy ocean floor with a scuba diver descending toward it. The waterline itself — visible as a distorted, refracted boundary across the center — is the image's most visually striking element.

THE WATERLINE (center, approximately 45-50% from top):

The horizontal line where air meets water crosses the image at approximately 45% from the top. This waterline is NOT a clean, straight line — it is rendered with the characteristic visual properties of a real split-level photograph:
- MENISCUS: The water surface curves slightly upward where it meets the camera housing (implied), creating a slight bowl shape
- WAVE RIPPLES: Small surface waves create an irregular, gently undulating boundary — not dramatic waves but the light chop of a calm tropical sea
- REFRACTION: Objects below the waterline appear slightly magnified and shifted due to water's refractive index — the wreck below appears slightly larger and closer than it would if viewed from the same distance in air
- SURFACE TEXTURE: The water surface catches the sunlight in bright, specular highlights — each small wave crest a flash of white against the blue

THE WORLD ABOVE (0-45% from top):

A tropical sky and seascape:
- SKY: A warm, dramatic sky transitioning from deep cerulean blue (#1A5A8B) at the top to warm golden (#FFD080) near the horizon — late afternoon tropical light. Cumulus clouds in brilliant white with warm grey undersides.
- ISLAND: In the distance (centered, approximately 30-40% from top), a small volcanic island — a dark, jungle-covered cone rising from the sea, with a thin wisp of cloud caught on its peak. The island is rendered with atmospheric perspective — slightly hazy, blue-shifted, establishing the tropical setting.
- SEA SURFACE: The water surface visible above the waterline is deep tropical blue (#0A3A6A) with sunlight sparkles — a beautiful, inviting ocean surface that gives no hint of the treasure below.
- A small BOAT is moored in the middle distance — a dive boat with a flag flying, establishing that an expedition is underway.

THE WORLD BELOW (50-100% from top):

The underwater world — a completely different visual environment from the world above:

WATER COLOR: The underwater space is filled with clear tropical water in various shades of blue-green — bright turquoise (#20A0A0) near the surface where sunlight penetrates, deepening to darker blue (#0A4060) at the bottom. Visible sunbeams penetrate from above — diagonal shafts of bright, warm light that cut through the blue water, creating volumetric light rays.

THE SHIPWRECK (center-bottom, 65-90% from top):

A wooden sailing ship — a 17th or 18th-century galleon — lies on the sandy ocean floor, partially broken and heavily encrusted with marine growth:
- The HULL is broken amidships, the bow section listing to port, the stern section relatively upright. The original wood is dark, waterlogged, and barely visible beneath decades of marine colonization.
- CORAL GROWTH: The entire wreck is covered in coral — massive brain corals in warm brown and cream, branching staghorn corals in pale purple, and colorful sponges in bright orange (#E08030) and deep red (#A02020). The coral has transformed the wreck from a ruin into a living reef.
- STRUCTURAL DETAILS: The ship's ribs are visible where the hull planking has rotted away — dark curved timbers like the skeleton of a whale. The stern section retains carved decorative elements — now coral-covered but still recognizable as ornamental scrollwork. A cannon protrudes from a gun port, green with verdigris.
- The ship's NAME is faintly visible on the stern — "GOLDEN SERPENT" in carved letters, partially obscured by coral growth but legible.

GOLD SCATTER: On the sandy bottom around the wreck, GLINTING OBJECTS — gold coins, a gold chain, the corner of a treasure chest protruding from the sand — catch the sunlight shafts and gleam with the warm yellow (#FFD040) of gold. These small points of warm gold against the cool blue water are the treasure the diver seeks.

THE DIVER (center, approximately 60-70% from top):

A scuba diver descending toward the wreck — rendered in mid-descent, body angled head-down, fins above. The diver wears a black wetsuit with a bright yellow (#FFD040) tank — matching the gold of the treasure, visually connecting the seeker to what they seek. Bubbles rise from the regulator in a stream of silver spheres that trail upward toward the surface. The diver carries an underwater light (off, in the bright ambient light) and a mesh collection bag. They are the link between the two worlds — descending from the upper world of sky and air into the lower world of wreck and treasure.

MARINE LIFE:

The water around the wreck teems with life:
- A school of silver fish (#C0C8D0) swirls around the bow section
- A sea turtle glides through the background
- A barracuda hovers motionless near the stern
- Small, colorful reef fish dart among the coral growth

TEXT — ADVENTURE BOLD:

Title (positioned at 3-16% from top, centered in the sky):
"THE WRECK of the" — in a bold, slightly weathered serif (think Playfair Display Bold with subtle distressing) in warm gold (#FFD040). Medium size.
"GOLDEN SERPENT" — on the next line, LARGER, same font, in deep sea blue (#0A3A6A). The gold-to-blue title mirrors the above/below split of the image.

Subtitle (positioned at 18% from top): "A Diving Adventure" — in small sans-serif in warm gold (#FFD040), letter-spacing 0.2em.

Author name (positioned at 92-95% from top, against the dark underwater bottom): "CAPTAIN ARIA BLACKWELL-OKAFOR" — in sans-serif in warm gold (#FFD040), letter-spacing 0.15em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Exciting, treasure-hungry, split between worlds — the feeling of floating at the surface of a tropical ocean, looking down through crystal-clear water at a shipwreck that has kept its golden secrets for centuries, and knowing that in thirty seconds you will be down there, hands in the sand, pulling coins from the dark.

THIS IS SPLIT-LEVEL OCEAN PHOTOGRAPHY. Above and below the surface in a single frame. The beauty is in the duality — two complete worlds sharing one image, separated by a wavering line of light, connected by a diver and a dream of gold.
