---

A visually striking book cover rendered in the authentic style of ancient Egyptian tomb painting — the flat, decorative, hieratic art tradition that adorned the burial chambers of pharaohs for three thousand years. The cover follows ALL the strict visual conventions of Egyptian painting: figures shown in the characteristic composite view (head in profile, eye shown frontally, shoulders frontal, waist and legs in profile), flat unmodeled color, no perspective, hierarchical scaling (important figures are larger), and decorative register bands organizing the composition. The result is immediately recognizable as Egyptian art and strikingly beautiful in its formal precision.

THE COMPOSITION — THREE HORIZONTAL REGISTERS:

Egyptian tomb paintings are organized in horizontal bands called registers, separated by thin lines. This cover uses three registers:

UPPER REGISTER (15-35% from top) — THE HEAVENS:

A decorative band depicting the sky goddess Nut arching over the scene — her body rendered as a long, curved figure stretching from left to right across the register, her body decorated with stars (five-pointed shapes in gold #D4AF37). Below her, a winged sun disk in gold and blue (#1A4A8B) spreads its wings protectively across the register's width. This register establishes the sacred, cosmic context.

MIDDLE REGISTER (35-70% from top) — THE MAIN SCENE:

The primary narrative scene, depicting the architect presenting his plans to the pharaoh:

THE PHARAOH (left side, larger): Seated on a throne, rendered at hierarchical scale (approximately 1.5x the size of other figures). He wears the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt — the characteristic combined pschent crown in white (#F0E8D0) and red (#CC3A1A). His skin is painted in the traditional Egyptian male convention of warm reddish-brown (#A06030). He wears a broad collar (usekh) of turquoise (#20A0A0), gold, and lapis blue (#1A3A8B) beads rendered as geometric patterns. A false beard extends from his chin — the thin, braided ceremonial beard of pharaonic authority. He holds the crook and flail crossed over his chest.

THE ARCHITECT (right side, smaller): Standing before the pharaoh, presenting an unrolled papyrus. He is rendered at normal scale — smaller than the pharaoh (hierarchical convention). His skin is the same reddish-brown. He wears a white linen kilt and a simple broad collar. His head is shaved (the convention for priests and officials). In his extended hands, the unrolled papyrus shows a simplified architectural plan — the floor plan of a temple or pyramid, rendered in fine black lines.

BETWEEN THEM: A small offering table laden with food offerings — rendered in the flat, spread-out perspective of Egyptian art where objects are shown from their most recognizable angle: bread loaves from the side, a duck from above, fruits arranged vertically rather than in depth.

ARCHITECTURAL ELEMENTS: Behind the pharaoh, a stylized palace column — a papyrus-bundle column in green (#2A6A40) with a gold (#D4AF37) capital. Behind the architect, a partially constructed building — stone blocks stacked in a stepped pattern, with tiny worker figures (much smaller, hierarchically scaled) carrying stones up ramps.

LOWER REGISTER (70-85% from top) — THE CONSTRUCTION:

A narrative band showing the construction process — workers building the architect's design:
- Rows of tiny figures (rendered at the smallest hierarchical scale) pulling stone blocks on wooden sledges
- A figure pouring water in front of the sledge (the Egyptian technique for reducing friction)
- Overseers with staffs
- A partially completed structure rising at the right edge
All figures follow the same composite-view convention as the main figures, just at smaller scale.

EGYPTIAN PAINTING TECHNIQUE:

- FLAT COLOR: No shading, no modeling, no gradients. Every area is a single, flat, opaque color — the characteristic look of mineral pigment applied to plastered wall
- BOLD BLACK OUTLINES: Every figure and object defined by confident black (#0A0A0A) outline in consistent weight
- COMPOSITE VIEW: All human figures shown in the Egyptian convention — head in profile (facing right, the standard direction), eye shown as if viewed from the front (a full almond shape), shoulders facing the viewer, waist turning to profile, legs in profile with both feet visible (one in front of the other, both showing the arch — the Egyptian convention of showing the inner side of both feet)
- HIERARCHICAL SCALING: The pharaoh is largest, the architect is medium, the workers are smallest
- REGISTER LINES: Thin black horizontal lines separate the three registers and define the ground line on which figures stand
- HIEROGLYPHIC COLUMNS: Vertical columns of hieroglyphic text (decorative, not necessarily readable) fill empty spaces beside the figures — the characteristic way Egyptian art fills negative space with text

- Black (carbon): #0A0A0A
- Sandstone ground: #E8D0A0 — the background color, representing the wall surface

TEXT — HIEROGLYPHIC INTEGRATION:

Title: "THE PHARAOH'S ARCHITECT" is integrated into the composition as a decorative cartouche — the characteristic oval enclosure used for royal names in hieroglyphic writing. The cartouche is positioned at 5-14% from top, centered in the upper register. The English text inside the cartouche is rendered in a font that echoes the angular, geometric quality of hieroglyphic writing, in gold (#D4AF37) against a blue (#1A3A8B) cartouche interior.

Subtitle: "A Novel of Ancient Egypt" — in small text below the cartouche, in Egyptian red (#CC3A1A), styled as a decorative inscription band.

Author name: "IMHOTEP VALE-OKAFOR" — in a small cartouche at the bottom of the image, in gold on blue, matching the title treatment.

OVERALL MOOD:

Ancient, ceremonial, monumental — the feeling of descending into a torch-lit tomb chamber and seeing, on the wall, a painting that has preserved a moment from 3,500 years ago with the same vivid color it had when the painter set down their brush. Egyptian tomb painting is art designed for eternity — and it achieved its goal.

THIS IS ANCIENT EGYPTIAN TOMB PAINTING. Flat mineral pigment, composite-view figures, hierarchical scaling, register bands. The beauty is in the formal precision — a visual language refined over three millennia that turns human figures into timeless symbols.
