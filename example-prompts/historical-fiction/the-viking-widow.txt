---

A powerful book cover rendered as the surface of a carved Viking runestone — a large, grey granite memorial stone with an elaborate carved design in the characteristic interlacing animal-ornament style of the Viking Age. The carving depicts intertwining serpents, a central female figure, and runic text, all rendered with the flowing, ribbon-like quality of Norse decorative art. The stone surface is painted in the traditional manner — red ochre and white lime on grey stone — and shows weathering and age.

THE STONE SURFACE:

The entire background is the surface of a large granite runestone — grey (#808080) with the characteristic granular texture of weathered granite. The stone surface shows natural variation: darker mineral inclusions, lighter quartz veins, and the slight roughness of stone that has stood outdoors for a thousand years. Moss and lichen grow in patches — small, circular patches of pale green-grey (#A0A880) lichen and deeper green (#4A5A30) moss, particularly in the carved grooves where moisture collects.

THE CARVED DESIGN (filling 15-85% of the image):

The carving follows the URNES STYLE — the last and most elegant of the Viking Age animal ornament styles, characterized by flowing, asymmetrical interlacing of slender, graceful animal forms:

THE GREAT SERPENT: A massive serpentine creature — the characteristic Urnes-style beast — coils and interlaces across the entire stone surface, its body forming the frame and structure of the composition. The serpent's body is a long, smooth, ribbon-like form that weaves over and under itself in complex knot patterns. Its head (at the upper portion of the stone) has the characteristic Urnes features: an almond-shaped eye, a long snout with curling lip, and tendrils that extend from the head and interlace with the body. The serpent's body is carved in low relief — raised approximately 1-2cm above the stone surface — and painted with red ochre (#A04030), the traditional Viking runestone color.

THE CENTRAL FIGURE — THE WIDOW: Within the coils of the great serpent, a human female figure stands — rendered in the stylized, geometric manner of Viking Age figure carving. She faces the viewer frontally (unusual in Viking art, which typically shows figures in profile — the frontal stance adds power). She wears a long dress and a characteristic Viking Age oval brooch (tortoise brooch) at each shoulder — small, oval, decorated shapes rendered in the carving. Her hair is long and braided, rendered as interlacing lines that merge with the serpent's body coils — woman and beast sharing the same flowing ornamental language. In one hand, she holds a sword — point downward, the grip at her chest. In the other, a key — the symbol of the Viking-age woman's authority over the household. The figure is carved in deeper relief than the serpent and painted in white lime (#E8E0D0), making her stand out against the red serpent and grey stone.

SMALLER INTERLACING BEASTS: Around the central figure and serpent, smaller animal forms weave and interlace — birds, smaller serpents, and quadrupeds with elongated bodies that twist into knot patterns. These secondary figures fill the spaces between the main serpent's coils, creating the characteristic Norse horror vacui (fear of empty space) that fills every available surface with interlacing ornament.

RUNIC INSCRIPTION: Along the outer edge of the stone, following its contour, a band of runic text — the Elder Futhark or Younger Futhark runes carved in a continuous line within a serpent-body border (the traditional format where the rune band IS the body of a serpent). The runes are carved as clean, angular shapes in the grey stone and painted in red ochre. The inscription reads (in Old Norse transliterated to runes): a memorial formula appropriate to a widow commissioning a stone for her fallen husband.

CARVING TECHNIQUE:

- LOW RELIEF: The design is carved in low relief — raised above the background surface by 1-2cm, creating real shadows and a three-dimensional quality
- CHIP CARVING: The background between the raised design elements shows the characteristic chip-carved texture of runestone carving — small, angled chisel marks creating a rough, stippled background that contrasts with the smooth raised forms
- PAINT RESIDUE: The red ochre and white lime paint is NOT perfectly preserved — it has partially weathered away, showing the bare grey stone beneath in patches. This selective weathering creates a varied, aged surface where some areas are fully painted and others show only traces of color
- SHADOW: The relief carving creates real shadows — the raised serpent body casts shadows on the chipped background, the figure casts shadows on the serpent coils behind her. These shadows add depth and drama, especially in raking (side) light
- WEATHERING: Edges of the carving are slightly softened by a thousand years of rain and frost — not sharp-edged like new carving but gently rounded

COLOR PALETTE — RUNESTONE:

- Granite grey: #808080 — the stone surface
- Red ochre paint: #A04030 — serpent, runes, traditional Viking color
- White lime paint: #E8E0D0 — the central figure, highlights
- Lichen green-grey: #A0A880 — biological growth
- Moss dark green: #4A5A30 — deeper growth in crevices
- Shadow dark: #404040 — carved relief shadows
- Chip-carved background: #606060 — roughened stone texture

TEXT — RUNIC INTEGRATION:

Title (positioned at 5-14% from top, centered above the main carving):
"THE VIKING" — in a font inspired by runic letterforms — angular, with straight lines and sharp angles echoing the geometric precision of Futhark runes. In red ochre (#A04030) — the same paint color as the carved serpent, integrating the text with the stone's visual language.
"WIDOW" — on the next line, same runic-inspired font, LARGER, in white lime (#E8E0D0) — matching the central figure's paint. The red-to-white shift mirrors the serpent-to-figure hierarchy of the carving.

Subtitle (positioned at 16% from top): "A Saga of the North" — in smaller angular letters in granite grey (#606060), letter-spacing 0.15em.

Author name (positioned at 88-92% from top, near the base of the stone): "SIGRID THORNSDOTTIR-OKAFOR" — in red ochre (#A04030) angular letters, integrated with the runic inscription band.

OVERALL MOOD:

Ancient, powerful, enduring — the feeling of standing in a Scandinavian field and finding a thousand-year-old stone that still tells its story in carved serpents and painted runes. The runestone aesthetic communicates deep time and cultural permanence — these stones were carved to last forever, and many of them have. The widow figure at the center, holding both sword and key, embodies the Viking-age woman's dual authority: keeper of the home and, when necessary, defender of it.

THIS IS NORSE RUNESTONE CARVING. Low relief on granite, red ochre and white lime paint, interlacing Urnes-style animal ornament. The beauty is in the flow — the way serpentine bodies weave in and out of each other, creating patterns of infinite complexity from a few simple, flowing lines.
