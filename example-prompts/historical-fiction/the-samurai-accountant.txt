---

A striking book cover rendered in the authentic visual style of Edo-period Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints — the flat, graphic, boldly outlined illustration tradition that produced some of the most recognizable art in world history. The image follows the strict visual conventions of ukiyo-e: figures rendered in flat color with bold black outlines, no Western perspective or shadow, stylized natural elements, and the characteristic color palette of traditional Japanese mineral and vegetable pigments. The style is not a modern interpretation OF ukiyo-e — it is rendered AS ukiyo-e, as though this were an actual print pulled from a carved woodblock in an Edo workshop.

THE SCENE — A SAMURAI AT HIS ACCOUNTS:

A single figure — a samurai in formal dress — sits at a low writing desk in a Japanese interior, surrounded by scrolls, account books, and an abacus. The composition follows ukiyo-e conventions: the figure is positioned slightly right of center, rendered in three-quarter view, with the interior space defined by flat, geometric architectural elements.

THE SAMURAI (center-right, 25-75% from top):

A man in his 40s, sitting in formal seiza position (kneeling with legs folded beneath) at a low lacquered writing desk. He is rendered in the ukiyo-e tradition:

FACE: Stylized in the characteristic ukiyo-e manner — a smooth, pale face (#F0E0C8) with minimal modeling, defined by confident black (#0A0A0A) outline. The features are conventionalized: narrow eyes rendered as a few precise curved lines, a small straight nose as a single line, thin lips. The expression is focused and serious — the furrowed brow suggested by two small parallel lines between the eyebrows.

CLOTHING: He wears formal kamishimo — the Edo-period samurai's official dress: a kataginu (sleeveless jacket with exaggerated shoulders) over a kosode (robe), in the characteristic ukiyo-e rendering where fabric patterns are the primary visual interest. The kataginu is rendered in flat indigo blue (#1A3A6A) with a family mon (crest) in white — a geometric circular design on each shoulder. The kosode beneath is rendered in deep charcoal grey with a subtle geometric pattern. A katana (sword) rests on a wooden rack behind him — a reminder that this accountant is also a warrior.

HANDS: Precisely rendered — one hand holds a calligraphy brush, poised over an open account book. The other hand rests on the abacus (soroban), fingers mid-calculation. The brush hand is the more detailed — the fingers curve around the brush shaft in the specific grip of Japanese calligraphy.

THE INTERIOR AND OBJECTS:

THE DESK: A low lacquered writing desk (#1A0A0A with red-brown lacquer accents) with a suzuri (inkstone) holding freshly ground ink, a water dropper in ceramic, and several brushes in a bamboo holder.

ACCOUNT BOOKS: Open volumes with columns of Japanese characters — the characteristic format of Edo-period commercial records. The writing is vertical, right-to-left, in black ink on pale paper. Numbers and calculations are visible.

THE ABACUS (SOROBAN): A wooden frame abacus with bamboo beads — rendered in precise detail, the beads in mid-calculation position.

SCROLLS: Rolled and unrolled scrolls scattered around the desk — some tied with silk cord, some weighted open with small stones. One scroll shows a financial diagram — a flow chart of money between entities.

THE ROOM: Defined by ukiyo-e architectural conventions — tatami mat floor rendered as a flat, warm straw-colored (#D0C090) area with visible mat-edge lines; shoji screens in the background as a grid of thin black lines on white; a tokonoma (alcove) with a hanging scroll painting of a crane.

THROUGH AN OPEN SHOJI: At the left side, a shoji screen is slid open, revealing a garden view — rendered in the flat, stylized ukiyo-e landscape manner: a stylized pine tree in dark green (#1A4A2A), a stone lantern, and distant mountains as simple layered blue (#6080A0) shapes.

UKIYO-E TECHNIQUE:

- BOLD BLACK OUTLINES: Every element defined by confident black lines of varying weight — thicker for major forms, thinner for details. The lines have the characteristic quality of woodblock printing: slightly rough-edged where ink transferred from carved wood to paper
- FLAT COLOR: No gradients, no shading (with one exception: bokashi, the graduated color at the top of the sky visible through the shoji, transitioning from pale to deeper blue). All areas are flat, solid color fills
- NO SHADOWS: Following ukiyo-e convention, there are no cast shadows. Depth is suggested by overlapping, not by light and shadow
- REGISTRATION MARKS: Very subtle — the slight misalignment between the black outline block and the color blocks that is characteristic of multi-block woodblock printing. Color fills don't PERFECTLY meet the outlines — tiny gaps or overlaps are visible
- PAPER TEXTURE: The washi (Japanese paper) surface is visible throughout — a warm, slightly fibrous cream (#FFF0D8) with the characteristic soft, absorbent quality of handmade Japanese paper. Where ink and pigment are thin, the paper texture shows through
- CARTOUCHE: In the upper-right corner, a traditional ukiyo-e title cartouche — a decorative bordered panel containing vertical Japanese-style text

COLOR PALETTE — TRADITIONAL JAPANESE PIGMENTS:

TEXT — INTEGRATED AS UKIYO-E CARTOUCHE:

Title: "THE SAMURAI ACCOUNTANT" appears within a traditional ukiyo-e title cartouche in the upper-right corner — a vertical rectangular panel with a decorative border in vermillion (#CC3A1A). The title text is rendered vertically (reading top-to-bottom) in a font that echoes the angular, brush-stroke quality of Japanese calligraphy adapted for Latin characters. The text is in sumi black (#0A0A0A) against the cream cartouche interior.

Subtitle: "A Novel of Edo Japan" — in a smaller cartouche below the title, in indigo blue (#1A3A6A).

Author name: "KENJI THORNTON-OKAFOR" — in a small rectangular cartouche at the bottom of the image, in vermillion. A small red seal stamp (hanko) appears beside the author name — a square vermillion impression with a simplified character inside.

OVERALL MOOD:

Precise, culturally rich, unexpectedly compelling — the combination of samurai warrior culture with the mundane reality of financial accounting creates an inherent narrative tension that the ukiyo-e style elevates to art. The woodblock print aesthetic grounds the story firmly in its historical period while the subject matter (a warrior doing math) subverts genre expectations.

THIS IS UKIYO-E WOODBLOCK PRINT ART. Bold outlines, flat color, Japanese pigment palette, washi paper texture. The beauty is in the tradition — centuries of artistic refinement distilled into confident lines and luminous flat color, depicting a warrior whose most dangerous weapon is an abacus.
