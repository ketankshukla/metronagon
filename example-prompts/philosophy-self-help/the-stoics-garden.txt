---

A refined, timeless book cover rendered as a classical marble bas-relief carving — a rectangular panel of white Carrara marble with a garden scene carved in low and medium relief. The entire image simulates the appearance of actual carved stone: white marble surfaces, grey shadow in the recesses, subtle stone veining, and the characteristic soft-edged quality of marble that has been carved with chisel and rasp. There is NO COLOR — only the monochrome palette of white marble, grey shadow, and the warm highlight of stone catching light.

THE MARBLE SURFACE:

The background is polished white Carrara marble (#F0ECE8) — not pure white but the warm, slightly grey-blue white of real marble. The marble surface shows:
- VEINING: Subtle grey (#C0B8B0) vein patterns running through the stone — the characteristic meandering, branching lines of natural marble. The veins are delicate and add organic texture to the geometric carving.
- POLISH: The flat background areas have a soft, satin polish — slightly reflective, catching ambient light with a gentle sheen.
- A thin, simple border frame is carved around the perimeter — a raised rectangular frame approximately 2% wide, with a simple egg-and-dart molding pattern along its inner edge.

THE RELIEF CARVING (filling 15-85% of the image):

A classical garden scene carved in varying depths of relief:

THE GARDEN: A formal philosophical garden — the kind of garden where Stoic philosophers actually taught (the Stoa Poikile's garden, Epicurus's garden):

CENTRAL TREE: A large, ancient olive tree carved in medium relief — its trunk gnarled and thick, its branches spreading wide. The olive tree is the Stoic symbol of endurance and practical wisdom. The trunk's bark texture is carved with fine chisel marks. The leaves are carved as small, simplified shapes in low relief — the characteristic stylized foliage of classical relief sculpture.

GARDEN ELEMENTS: Around the tree, carved garden details:
- A low stone bench beneath the tree — carved in medium relief, its surface smooth, its legs simple and classical. The bench invites sitting, contemplation.
- A stone path leading to the bench — carved as a flat surface slightly below the garden ground level, with individual paving stones suggested by fine incised lines.
- Low hedgerows in geometric patterns — carved in very low relief as textured bands suggesting clipped boxwood.
- A small fountain or basin — a simple circular stone basin on a pedestal, water suggested by smooth, concave carving.

PHILOSOPHICAL OBJECTS: On or near the bench, small carved objects:
- An open scroll — its rolled ends curling upward in medium relief, its surface flat, suggesting text without actually showing letters.
- A small oil lamp — the characteristic terracotta-style lamp of the ancient world, carved in fine detail.

DECORATIVE ELEMENTS:
- Along the base of the relief, a carved border of acanthus leaves — the classical architectural ornament, each leaf carved with the characteristic deep undercutting that creates dramatic shadow.
- Two carved columns (partial, at left and right edges) suggesting a portico or stoa — Doric order, with simple capitals and fluted shafts.

RELIEF CARVING TECHNIQUE:

- HIGH RELIEF: The olive tree's trunk and main branches project furthest from the background — approximately "2cm" of depth (suggested by shadow depth). These elements have strong shadows and appear most three-dimensional.
- MEDIUM RELIEF: The bench, the scroll, the lamp, the fountain, and the tree's secondary branches — projecting moderately, with softer shadows.
- LOW RELIEF: The hedgerows, the path, the foliage details, and the background elements — barely raised above the flat background, defined more by their outline than their depth.
- INCISED LINES: The finest details — leaf veins, scroll text suggestion, paving stone joints — are carved INTO the surface rather than raised above it.
- SHADOW: The depth variation creates a natural shadow pattern — deeper carvings have darker shadows (#908880), shallower areas have lighter shadows (#C8C0B8). The light is directional from the upper left, creating consistent shadow on the right and lower sides of all raised elements.

THE MARBLE QUALITY:

The marble must look REAL:
- The surface has the characteristic soft, slightly waxy quality of carved marble — not the hard shine of polished granite but the gentle luster of worked marble.
- Where the chisel has carved, the surface is slightly rougher — the carved background behind the relief elements shows fine chisel texture that contrasts with the polished surfaces of the raised elements.
- The edges where raised surfaces meet the background are NOT razor-sharp — they are gently rounded, as marble is too soft to hold perfectly sharp edges over time.

COLOR PALETTE — MARBLE MONOCHROME:

- Marble white: #F0ECE8 — polished surfaces, brightest areas
- Marble warm: #E0D8D0 — slightly shadowed flat surfaces
- Vein grey: #C0B8B0 — natural marble veining
- Light shadow: #C8C0B8 — shallow relief shadows
- Medium shadow: #A0988 — medium relief shadows
- Deep shadow: #908880 — deepest carved recesses
- Darkest recess: #706860 — the deepest undercuts

TEXT — CARVED INTO THE MARBLE:

Title (positioned at 5-16% from top, within the upper portion of the marble panel):
"THE STOIC'S" — rendered as INSCRIBED text — letters carved INTO the marble surface in the classical Roman square capital style (the monumental inscription letterforms of ancient Rome, like the Trajan Column inscription). The letters are carved with V-shaped incision, creating shadow that defines each letterform. The inscription style is precise, geometric, and timelessly elegant. Medium-large.
"GARDEN" — on the next line, same inscribed Roman capitals, LARGER. The carving is deeper for this word — more shadow, more visual weight.

Subtitle (positioned at 18% from top): "ANCIENT WISDOM FOR MODERN MINDS" — in smaller inscribed Roman capitals, lighter carving (shallower incision, less shadow).

Author name (positioned at 86-90% from top, within the acanthus border area): "MARCUS AURELIUS OSEI-THORNTON" — in small inscribed Roman capitals.

OVERALL MOOD:

Timeless, contemplative, solid — the feeling of sitting in a garden that has been tended for two thousand years, reading a text that was as true when it was written as it is today. The marble relief aesthetic communicates permanence — these ideas are not trends but truths, carved in stone, enduring. The classical visual language signals serious philosophical content without being intimidating — the garden setting softens the stone's severity.

THIS IS CLASSICAL MARBLE BAS-RELIEF SCULPTURE. White Carrara marble, relief carving in varying depths, Roman inscription lettering. The beauty is in the material — stone that has been transformed by human hands into a scene of contemplative beauty, every surface carrying the evidence of the chisel that shaped it.
