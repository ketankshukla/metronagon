---

A beautiful, contemplative book cover rendered as a close-up photograph of a ceramic bowl that has been broken and repaired using the Japanese art of kintsugi — the practice of mending broken pottery with gold lacquer, making the repair visible and beautiful rather than concealing it. The photograph shows the bowl's surface at close range, where the network of gold-filled crack lines becomes an abstract landscape of golden rivers on warm clay terrain. The image is a perfect visual metaphor for the book's message: what has been broken can be made more beautiful than it was before.

THE CERAMIC SURFACE (filling the entire image):

The image is a close-up photograph of a ceramic bowl's interior surface — magnified enough that the curvature of the bowl is subtle and the surface fills the frame as a gently curving landscape:

THE CLAY BODY: The ceramic is a warm, earth-toned stoneware — not glossy porcelain but a matte, slightly rough clay body with natural texture:
- The base color is warm, muted terracotta (#B89070) — the natural color of high-fired clay
- The surface has a thin, matte glaze in warm grey-green (#8A9080) that is intentionally imperfect — varying in thickness, showing the clay body through in some areas, pooling slightly thicker in concave areas
- The glaze surface shows the subtle marks of handmaking: tiny dimples, very faint tool marks, and the slight irregularity that distinguishes handmade pottery from factory production
- Where the glaze is thin, the warm clay body shows through, creating a mottled, organic surface

THE KINTSUGI GOLD (the repaired cracks):

The bowl was broken into approximately seven or eight pieces and reassembled with gold-mixed lacquer — the urushi lacquer and gold powder mixture used in traditional kintsugi:

THE CRACK PATTERN: A network of fracture lines radiates across the surface — some straight, some branching, some curving to follow the clay's natural structure. The cracks create an organic web that divides the bowl's surface into irregular sections. The crack pattern is not symmetrical or predictable — it follows the random geometry of actual ceramic fracture, where cracks follow grain, stress, and the specific physics of the impact that broke the piece.

THE GOLD FILL: Each crack is filled with gold (#D4AF37 to #FFE070) — bright, warm, unmistakably precious metal mixed into the lacquer:
- MAIN CRACKS: The primary fracture lines are wide (approximately 1-2% of image width) and filled with thick gold lacquer. The gold surface is slightly raised above the surrounding ceramic — the lacquer is built up to be level with or slightly proud of the ceramic surface. The gold has a rich, warm, slightly satin sheen — not mirror-bright but with the characteristic soft glow of gold powder in lacquer.
- SECONDARY CRACKS: Smaller fracture lines branch from the main cracks — thinner gold lines that create a finer network. These secondary lines are thinner and slightly lower — less lacquer was needed to fill them.
- HAIRLINE CRACKS: The finest fractures — barely visible lines of gold that radiate from the main cracks like capillaries. These are the thinnest gold lines, almost thread-like, adding intricate detail to the repair pattern.

GOLD SURFACE DETAIL: At this magnification, the gold lacquer surface shows its material nature:
- Visible gold powder particles within the lacquer matrix — tiny, bright points where individual gold flakes catch the light
- The lacquer surface has a subtle organic texture — slightly different from the ceramic glaze around it
- Where two crack lines meet (an intersection point), the gold pools slightly wider, creating a brighter node — a golden junction point
- The edges where gold meets ceramic are slightly irregular — the lacquer was applied by hand, guided into the crack but not perfectly constrained

THE ONE MISSING PIECE:

One small section of the bowl (approximately 8% of the image area, positioned in the lower-left) is MISSING — a piece that was lost when the bowl broke and could not be recovered. This gap has been filled with pure gold lacquer (#D4AF37) — a solid gold patch where the missing ceramic piece would have been. The gold fill is slightly concave (following the bowl's interior curve) and has a slightly different texture from the crack lines — it is a larger, smoother area of gold that reads as an intentional, beautiful addition rather than a flaw. This missing piece, filled entirely with gold, is the image's most striking element and its most powerful metaphor: what is missing has been replaced with something precious.

LIGHTING:

Warm, soft, directional light from the upper-left — creating:
- Bright, warm highlights on the gold surfaces where they catch the light directly — these highlights are the brightest points in the image, the gold singing against the matte ceramic
- Soft shadows in the ceramic's surface texture
- A gentle gradient across the bowl's curved surface — brighter where the curve faces the light, darker where it curves away
- The gold's reflective quality means it responds to light differently than the matte ceramic — the gold lines appear to glow while the ceramic absorbs light

COLOR PALETTE — CLAY AND GOLD:

- Clay terracotta: #B89070 — exposed clay body
- Glaze grey-green: #8A9080 — matte glaze surface
- Glaze pooled: #7A8070 — thicker glaze areas
- Gold bright: #FFE070 — highlight catches
- Gold warm: #D4AF37 — standard gold tone
- Gold shadow: #A08020 — gold in shadow
- Gold lacquer surface: #C8A030 — the body of the gold fill
- Background shadow: #4A3A28 — darkest ceramic areas

TEXT — WARM AND GROUNDED:

Title (positioned at 5-18% from top, centered):
"THE UNFINISHED" — in a warm, slightly organic serif font (think Cormorant or Freight Text — fonts with warmth and character) in warm gold (#D4AF37). Medium-large, letter-spacing 0.1em. The gold text echoes the kintsugi gold.
"SELF" — on the next line, same font, LARGER, in warm clay (#B89070) — matching the ceramic. The gold-to-clay shift says: you are both the precious repair AND the earthen vessel.

Subtitle (positioned at 20% from top): "Embracing Imperfection as a Path to Wholeness" — in small, light serif in muted sage (#8A9080), letter-spacing 0.15em.

Author name (positioned at 88-92% from top): "DR. YUKI ASHWORTH-OKAFOR" — in serif in warm gold (#D4AF37), letter-spacing 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Warm, healing, beautifully broken — the feeling of holding a bowl that was shattered and discovering that its repair has made it more beautiful, more valuable, and more meaningful than it was before it broke. The kintsugi philosophy — that breakage is not the end but a transformation — is communicated instantly by the image. The gold-filled cracks say: your scars are not flaws; they are your most precious features.

THIS IS KINTSUGI MACRO PHOTOGRAPHY. Gold-filled ceramic fractures, matte clay surfaces, precious metal repair. The beauty is in the damage — cracks that have been honored rather than hidden, breaks that have been filled with gold rather than glued with shame.
