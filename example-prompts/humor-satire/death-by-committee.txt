TYPE: Paperback Front Cover

GENRE: Humor / Workplace Comedy
ART STYLE: Retro 1950s commercial illustration — the bright, optimistic, slightly exaggerated illustration style of mid-century American magazine advertisements and book covers. Smiling figures with exaggerated expressions, bright saturated colors, visible brushwork, and the characteristic "everything is wonderful!" aesthetic of 1950s commercial art applied to a decidedly not-wonderful workplace scenario.

---

A bright, cheerful, deliberately retro book cover rendered in the style of 1950s commercial illustration — the upbeat, optimistic, slightly exaggerated art style used in mid-century American magazine ads, corporate brochures, and promotional materials. The illustration depicts a boardroom meeting where something has gone VERY wrong, but everyone maintains the forced smile and can-do attitude of 1950s corporate culture. The retro style's inherent cheerfulness makes the dark subject matter funnier — the disconnect between the bright, optimistic illustration and the grim content IS the joke.

THE SCENE — A BOARDROOM IN CRISIS:

A bright, saturated illustration of a 1950s-style corporate boardroom — the kind of room depicted in mid-century corporate literature: wood-paneled walls, a long mahogany table, executive chairs, and a large window showing a cheerful suburban skyline.

THE TABLE: A long, polished boardroom table (#5A3020 dark mahogany) with eight chairs around it. The table surface gleams with the exaggerated shininess of 1950s illustration — bright highlight streaks on the polished wood.

THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS: Seven people seated around the table, each one a 1950s character archetype rendered in the cheerful, slightly caricatured style of mid-century commercial art:

- THE CHAIRMAN (head of table): A silver-haired man in a grey flannel suit, frozen mid-speech with one finger raised. His expression is the forced smile of corporate authority. His face is rendered in the 1950s style: slightly pink complexion (#E8B8A0), exaggerated jaw, teeth visible in a wide smile.

- THE SECRETARY (to his right): A woman with a perfect 1950s hairstyle (victory rolls), taking notes on a steno pad. Her smile is mechanical. She wears a pencil behind her ear and a pearl necklace.

- THE YES-MAN: A young, eager man in a bow tie, nodding vigorously, his head rendered at a slight motion-blur angle to emphasize the nodding.

- THE SKEPTIC: An older woman with reading glasses on a chain, arms crossed, smile slightly less enthusiastic than the others — the only one showing a crack in the cheerful facade.

- THREE MORE MEMBERS: Various ages and styles, all smiling, all in period-appropriate business attire, all clearly uncomfortable about something.

THE EIGHTH CHAIR: One chair (at the far end of the table from the Chairman) is EMPTY — pushed back from the table at an angle, as though its occupant left suddenly. On the table in front of the empty chair: a coffee cup tipped over (a brown coffee stain spreading across papers), a pair of glasses (left behind), and what appears to be a resignation letter — or is it something more final?

THE DARK DETAILS (hidden in the cheerful scene):

Despite the bright, optimistic 1950s rendering, small details suggest something sinister:
- The AGENDA on the table (visible in front of the Chairman) reads: "ITEM 7: DISPOSAL OF [REDACTED] / ITEM 8: NEW BUSINESS"
- A HOUSEPLANT in the corner is dead — brown and wilted, the only non-cheerful element in the room
- Through the window, the cheerful suburban skyline includes, if you look closely, a single POLICE CAR with its lights on, parked outside the building
- The coffee stain from the empty chair's tipped cup has spread to form a shape that suspiciously resembles a body outline
- A MOTIVATIONAL POSTER on the wall reads: "THERE IS NO 'I' IN TEAM — BUT THERE IS ONE IN 'VICTIM'"

1950s ILLUSTRATION STYLE:

- BRIGHT, SATURATED COLORS: The palette is the characteristic 1950s commercial palette — bright, warm, optimistic colors pushed to high saturation: warm reds, bright blues, sunny yellows
- VISIBLE BRUSHWORK: The illustration shows the hand-of-the-artist — visible brush strokes, slightly rough color fills, the characteristic texture of gouache or casein paint on illustration board
- EXAGGERATED EXPRESSIONS: Faces are slightly caricatured — bigger smiles, wider eyes, more pronounced features than real life. This is the "everyone is happy" aesthetic of mid-century advertising.
- BLACK OUTLINES: Figures and objects are defined by confident black outlines of varying weight — thicker for major forms, thinner for details
- FLAT-ISH RENDERING: Color is applied in relatively flat areas with minimal subtle shading — the characteristic look of commercial illustration meant for print reproduction
- CROSS-HATCHING: Shadow areas use visible cross-hatching or parallel line shading — the pre-digital technique for creating tonal gradation in illustration

TEXT — RETRO BOOK COVER TYPOGRAPHY:

Title (positioned at 5-22% from top, centered above the scene):
"DEATH BY" — in a bold, retro display font (think the hand-lettered title treatments of 1950s paperback covers — slightly irregular, slightly playful, with the characteristic personality of pre-digital lettering) in bright red (#CC2020). Large, dynamic, slightly angled.
"COMMITTEE" — on the next line, same retro display style, LARGER, in dark boardroom blue (#1A3A6A). The word "COMMITTEE" is the longest and heaviest — it dominates the title block with the same oppressive weight that committees dominate office life.

Subtitle (positioned at 24% from top): "A Murder Mystery in Twelve Meetings" — in smaller, clean 1950s-style sans-serif in warm gold (#C8A030), letter-spacing 0.1em.

Author name (positioned at 88-92% from top): "PATRICIA THORNTON-OKAFOR" — in 1950s display lettering in dark red (#8B1A1A).

A STARBURST: In the upper-left corner, a bright yellow (#FFE060) starburst shape (the classic 1950s promotional burst) containing: "NOW WITH 40% MORE MEETINGS!" in small, bold, red text. This fake promotional element is the cover's final retro-comedy touch.

OVERALL MOOD:

Cheerful, sinister, satirically nostalgic — the feeling of corporate culture stripped back to its mid-century roots and exposed as the politely murderous institution it always was. The 1950s illustration style is inherently funny when applied to dark content — the forced optimism of the era's visual culture becomes a commentary on the forced optimism of all corporate culture.

THIS IS 1950s COMMERCIAL ILLUSTRATION. Bright saturated gouache, exaggerated expressions, visible brushwork, cheerful rendering of uncheerful content. The beauty is in the disconnect — a style designed to sell soap and cigarettes, repurposed to illustrate corporate murder.
