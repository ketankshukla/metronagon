A BRIEF HISTORY OF BAD DECISIONS — A MEMOIR
TYPE: Paperback Front Cover
DIMENSIONS: 1024 x 1536 pixels, sRGB color profile
GENRE: Humor / Memoir
ART STYLE: Passport stamps and travel stickers collage — the entire cover is a collage of overlapping passport stamps, visa stickers, airline baggage tags, hotel labels, and immigration stamps from around the world, arranged chaotically on the inside cover of a worn passport. Each stamp represents a different bad decision (a different country, a different disaster). The aesthetic of a well-traveled passport that has seen too much, combined with the scrapbook energy of a life lived impulsively.

---

A chaotic, colorful, densely layered book cover designed to look like the inside pages of a WELL-USED PASSPORT — covered in overlapping entry stamps, visa stickers, airline tags, and immigration marks from dozens of countries. But each stamp, instead of standard immigration text, contains humorous text referencing a bad decision made in that location. The overall effect is a visual autobiography told through bureaucratic stamps — each one a different country, a different ink color, a different disaster, all layered on the worn pages of a passport that has been through too much.

THE PASSPORT PAGE BACKGROUND:

The background is the interior pages of a passport — the off-white (#E8E0D0) security-printed pages with the characteristic anti-forgery pattern: a very faint, repeating geometric watermark pattern (tiny eagles, stars, or geometric shapes in very pale blue-grey #D8D4D0) printed across the surface. The pages show wear: slightly yellowed at the edges, fold creases from the passport being sat on in back pockets, and a few small stains (coffee, wine, mystery substances).

THE STAMPS AND STICKERS (filling 10-90% of the image):

Approximately 20-25 overlapping stamps, stickers, and marks cover the passport pages, each in a different style and color:

ENTRY/EXIT STAMPS (circular, rectangular, and oval ink stamps):

- PARIS, FRANCE (oval stamp in blue ink #1A3A8B): "RÉPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE — ENTRÉE — FELL IN LOVE IN 24 HOURS — REGRETTED IN 48" with a date and small official-looking number

- BANGKOK, THAILAND (rectangular stamp in red ink #CC2020): "KINGDOM OF THAILAND — IMMIGRATION — GOT A TATTOO I CAN'T READ — IT PROBABLY SAYS 'SOUP'" with ornamental Thai-inspired border

- REYKJAVIK, ICELAND (circular stamp in dark blue #0A1A3A): "ENTERED ICELAND — LEFT DIGNITY AT THE BORDER — SEE ATTACHED INCIDENT REPORT"

- TOKYO, JAPAN (square stamp in vermillion #CC3A1A): Japanese-style official stamp with "KARAOKE INCIDENT — DURATION: 14 HOURS — NO FURTHER COMMENT"

- RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL (triangular stamp in green #1A6A3A): "REPÚBLICA FEDERATIVA DO BRASIL — CARNIVAL ENTRY PERMIT — LOST: WALLET, SHOES, SENSE OF SELF"

- AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS (rectangular stamp in orange #E08030): "KONINKRIJK DER NEDERLANDEN — RENTED A BICYCLE — ENDED UP IN BELGIUM"

- CAIRO, EGYPT (oval stamp in gold/brown #A08040): "ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT — RODE A CAMEL — CAMEL DID NOT CONSENT — INCIDENT #447"

- SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA (circular stamp in deep red #8B1A1A): "AUSTRALIAN BORDER FORCE — ENTRY GRANTED — SPIDER ENCOUNTER: YES — SCREAMING: ALSO YES"

Each stamp is rendered with the characteristic qualities of real passport stamps:
- INK VARIATION: Some stamps are clearly inked, others are faded (insufficient ink on the stamp pad), some are smudged (the passport was closed before the ink dried)
- OVERLAPPING: Stamps overlap each other — some partially obscured by later stamps, creating the characteristic layered archaeology of a well-used passport
- ANGLE VARIATION: Each stamp is applied at a different angle — immigration officers never stamp straight
- INK COLORS: Red, blue, purple, green, orange, black — the full range of immigration stamp inks

VISA STICKERS (larger, rectangular, printed):

Two or three full visa stickers — the larger, printed stickers that some countries attach to passport pages:
- A visa sticker in the style of a Schengen visa — portrait photo area (containing a small, obviously hungover photo of the book's protagonist), printed text, holographic security strip — with the occupation field reading "PROFESSIONAL BAD DECISION MAKER"
- A visa sticker with "DURATION OF STAY: UNTIL ASKED TO LEAVE" and a stamped "EXPIRED" across it in red

AIRLINE BAGGAGE TAGS:

Two or three small airline baggage tags (the adhesive kind) stuck to the page:
- "LHR → NRT — SEAT 42F — LOST BAGGAGE (AGAIN)" in the barcode-and-text format of real baggage tags
- "JFK → CDG — GATE CHANGE: YES — MISSED FLIGHT: ALSO YES"

HOTEL STICKERS:

One or two small vintage-style hotel labels:
- "GRAND HOTEL CATASTROPHE — ISTANBUL — EST. 1923 — 'WHERE EVERY STAY IS AN ADVENTURE (WHETHER YOU WANT IT OR NOT)'"

ADDITIONAL DETAILS:

- A small COFFEE RING STAIN overlapping several stamps — brown (#A08860), circular
- A PHONE NUMBER scrawled in pen on the page margin — with a note: "DON'T CALL — TRUST ME"
- A BOARDING PASS corner tucked into the page — just the edge visible, showing a departure city and an arrival city that make no geographic sense
- A tiny STICKER of a national flag, placed upside down

STAMP RENDERING:

Each stamp is rendered with material authenticity:
- Rubber stamp ink: slightly uneven coverage, slightly fuzzy edges where ink spread
- Printed stickers: crisp text, slightly peeling corners, holographic elements suggested by small rainbow-hued areas
- Handwritten annotations: blue and black ballpoint pen notes in margins
- The stamps use various typefaces: some serif, some sans-serif, some typewriter-style — matching the bureaucratic traditions of different countries

TEXT — PASSPORT TYPOGRAPHY:

Title: "A BRIEF HISTORY OF BAD DECISIONS" is rendered as the LARGEST STAMP on the page — a massive rectangular rubber stamp impression in vivid red ink (#CC2020), positioned at 15-35% from top, angled slightly (about 5 degrees clockwise). The stamp has a double-line rectangular border and the text in bold, slightly distorted stamped serif — the characteristic look of a large rubber stamp pressed with uneven pressure. "A BRIEF HISTORY" on the first line, "of BAD DECISIONS" on the second line, larger and bolder. Below the text, a small "CLASSIFIED" marking and a fake serial number.

Subtitle: "A Memoir" — handwritten in ballpoint pen (#1A2A5A) below the title stamp, with an arrow pointing to it — as though someone annotated the stamp.

Author name: "PASSPORT HOLDER: FELIX THORNTON-OKAFOR" — printed in the format of a passport's personal details page, positioned at 85-90% from top — the typewriter-style font of passport biodata pages.

OVERALL MOOD:

Chaotic, worldly, ruefully funny — the feeling of flipping through your passport after a year of impulsive travel and realizing that every stamp represents not just a place you went but a decision you probably shouldn't have made. The passport collage aesthetic transforms a memoir cover into a visual document of a life lived at full speed with insufficient planning — every stamp is a story, and every story ends with a lesson learned the hard way.

THIS IS PASSPORT STAMP AND TRAVEL STICKER COLLAGE. Overlapping ink stamps, visa stickers, baggage tags, and handwritten notes on worn passport pages. The beauty is in the chaos — a lifetime of travel and terrible judgment reduced to bureaucratic marks on paper.
