THE MIDDLE MANAGER'S GUIDE TO THE APOCALYPSE — A CORPORATE SATIRE
TYPE: Paperback Front Cover
DIMENSIONS: 1024 x 1536 pixels, sRGB color profile
GENRE: Humor / Corporate Satire
ART STYLE: Corporate PowerPoint presentation slide — the cover is designed to look like a single slide from a corporate presentation, complete with bullet points, a stock-photo-style image, a company logo, and the characteristic design templates of business presentation software. The apocalypse is presented as a quarterly business challenge. Ironic, deadpan, immediately recognizable as corporate culture.

---

A hilarious, deadpan book cover designed to look EXACTLY like a slide from a corporate PowerPoint presentation — the kind of slide presented in fluorescent-lit conference rooms by middle managers who believe that any crisis, including the literal end of the world, can be managed with proper process and stakeholder alignment. The cover's humor is entirely in its TONE: the apocalypse is treated as a standard business deliverable, complete with action items, a timeline, and a motivational stock photo. The design must be pixel-perfect corporate — genuinely indistinguishable from a real presentation slide, which is what makes it funny.

THE PRESENTATION TEMPLATE:

The cover uses a corporate presentation template — the kind of generic, slightly ugly, mass-produced design that comes pre-installed with business presentation software:

BACKGROUND: A gradient from corporate dark blue (#1A2A5A) at the top to slightly lighter corporate blue (#2A4A7A) at the bottom — the default gradient of a thousand interchangeable corporate templates.

HEADER BAR: A thin horizontal band of corporate gold (#C8A030) across the top (at approximately 3-4% from top) — the template's accent color.

FOOTER BAR: A thin horizontal band at the bottom (95-97% from top) containing standard slide footer elements in tiny white text: "CONFIDENTIAL — AMALGAMATED INDUSTRIES INC. — Q4 APOCALYPSE READINESS REVIEW — SLIDE 47 OF 312"

COMPANY LOGO: In the upper-right corner, a small, generic corporate logo — a stylized "AI" monogram in the corporate gold within a circular border. Below: "AMALGAMATED INDUSTRIES" in tiny sans-serif.

THE SLIDE CONTENT:

SLIDE TITLE (8-14% from top):
"Q4 STRATEGIC RESPONSE: END OF WORLD SCENARIO" — in bold, corporate sans-serif (think Arial Bold or Calibri Bold) in white (#FFFFFF). This is the slide's headline — the apocalypse framed as a quarterly strategic initiative.

SUBTITLE: "Cross-Functional Alignment for Optimal Apocalypse Outcomes" — in smaller sans-serif in corporate gold (#C8A030), below the title.

THE STOCK PHOTO (positioned at 18-48% from top, right side, approximately 45% of width):

A small "stock photo" — the kind of generic, slightly cheesy corporate stock photography used in presentations:

The photo shows a diverse group of five smiling business professionals in an office, giving thumbs-up gestures. They wear business casual attire. They stand in front of a whiteboard. They are SMILING — the aggressive, teeth-baring smile of corporate stock photography. Through the office window behind them, visible but slightly out of focus: THE APOCALYPSE — a massive fireball in the sky, a city skyline in flames, dark smoke clouds. The juxtaposition of cheerful, thumbs-up office workers and the literal end of the world through the window is the stock photo's visual joke.

The photo has the characteristic look of corporate stock: slightly oversaturated, slightly too-perfect lighting, the diversity-checkbox composition, and the watermark-free blandness of licensed stock imagery. It has a thin corporate blue (#1A2A5A) border.

THE BULLET POINTS (positioned at 18-48% from top, left side):

A bullet-point list in standard corporate presentation format — white text on the dark blue background, with small circular bullet markers in corporate gold:

• "Leverage existing apocalypse frameworks (see Appendix C)"
• "Align stakeholder expectations re: total annihilation"  
• "Action item: Update LinkedIn profiles before internet fails"
• "Synergize survival resources across departments"
• "Deadline: End of Quarter (or End of World, whichever comes first)"

The bullet points are in standard corporate sans-serif (Arial or Calibri), white, with the characteristic size and spacing of real presentation bullets. The humor is in the deadpan corporate language applied to apocalyptic content.

THE CHART (positioned at 52-78% from top, centered):

A simple bar chart — the kind of chart inserted into every corporate presentation:

CHART TITLE: "Apocalypse Readiness by Department (% Complete)"

Five horizontal bars, each a different corporate color:
- "Marketing: 12%" — short bar in corporate blue (#2A4A7A)
- "Sales: 8%" — very short bar in corporate gold (#C8A030)  
- "Engineering: 67%" — long bar in green (#2A7A4A)
- "HR: 3%" — barely visible bar in orange (#D08030)
- "Management: 94%*" — nearly full bar in red (#CC2020)

Below the chart, in tiny text: "* Management readiness consists entirely of updating evacuation plan to prioritize executive parking."

The chart has the standard corporate chart formatting: grey (#808080) axis lines, small sans-serif labels, and a thin border.

A MOTIVATIONAL QUOTE (positioned at 80-88% from top):

In a slightly different treatment (italic, centered, with decorative quotation marks in gold):

"Every apocalypse is just an opportunity wearing a disguise made of fire and brimstone."
— Brenda from Accounting

The fake inspirational quote, attributed to a mundane corporate figure, is the cover's final comedic beat.

TEXT — CORPORATE PRESENTATION:

Title: The book's ACTUAL title is integrated as the slide's title and subtitle. "THE MIDDLE MANAGER'S GUIDE TO THE APOCALYPSE" appears twice:
1. As the slide title/subtitle (described above, part of the presentation)
2. In a small "book band" or "sticker" element at the top — a slightly angled banner in red (#CC2020) with white text: "NOW A #1 BESTSELLER!" — the kind of promotional sticker publishers add. Inside this banner: "THE MIDDLE MANAGER'S GUIDE TO THE APOCALYPSE" in bold white sans-serif.

Subtitle: "A Corporate Satire" — in tiny text on the banner.

Author name (within the footer bar area): "BRENDA THORNTON-OKAFOR, MBA, PMP, CPA (RIP)" — in the slide footer's tiny white text, formatted as corporate credentials.

OVERALL MOOD:

Deadpan, satirical, painfully recognizable — the feeling of sitting in the world's last meeting, watching someone advance to slide 47 of 312 while the sky falls outside. The humor works because the corporate presentation format is SO accurately rendered that office workers will instinctively feel the dread of another all-hands meeting — and then laugh when they read what the meeting is about.

THIS IS CORPORATE PRESENTATION DESIGN as satire. PowerPoint template, stock photography, bullet points, bar charts. The beauty (and the horror) is in the accuracy — every element is pixel-perfect corporate, and the apocalypse is just another agenda item.
