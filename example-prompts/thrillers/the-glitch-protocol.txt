---

A disturbing, visually striking book cover depicting a human face in the process of being digitally corrupted — systematic glitch artifacts tear the image aapart in precise, algorithmic patterns while the face struggles to remain coherent. The aesthetic is digital glitch art: the specific visual artifacts that occur when image data is corrupted, hacked, or improperly decoded. Every glitch effect is based on real digital corruption phenomena — pixel sorting, data moshing, RGB channel displacement, JPEG compression artifacts, and scan-line displacement. The overall effect is a face being erased by technology — or being revealed by it.

THE BASE IMAGE — A FACE BEING CORRUPTED:

The underlying image is a straight-on passport-style photograph of a face — neutral expression, direct gaze, evenly lit. The face belongs to a person of ambiguous ethnicity and age (30s-40s), gender-neutral, with features that are generic enough to be anyone and specific enough to be unsettling. The face is rendered with photographic realism in the areas that remain uncorrupted — smooth skin, sharp eyes, neutral lips.

But the image is CORRUPTED. Approximately 60% of the face has been destroyed or displaced by various glitch effects, each one based on a real digital artifact:

PIXEL SORTING (affecting 20-40% from top, the forehead and upper face): Horizontal bands where the pixels have been algorithmically sorted by brightness — each row of pixels rearranged from darkest to lightest (or lightest to darkest), creating smooth, flowing gradient bands that destroy the image data while creating strangely beautiful abstract patterns. The sorted pixels flow from left to right in bands of skin tone, hair color, and background, creating an effect like the face is melting sideways.

RGB CHANNEL DISPLACEMENT (affecting the eye area, 35-50% from top): The three color channels (Red, Green, Blue) of the image have been separated and offset from each other — the red channel shifted 10 pixels left, the blue channel shifted 10 pixels right, the green channel remaining in place. This creates the characteristic "3D glasses" effect: triple-ghost images of the eyes in red, green, and blue, overlapping but not aligned. The eyes — the most human, most recognizable part of the face — are the most visually disrupted, split into three colored shadows that stare in slightly different directions.

SCAN-LINE DISPLACEMENT (affecting 50-70% from top, the nose and mouth area): Horizontal bands of the image have been shifted left or right by varying amounts, creating a stepped, zigzag distortion pattern. The nose and mouth are sliced into horizontal strips and displaced, each strip maintaining its original detail but offset from its neighbors. The effect creates a face that looks like it has been cut into ribbons and reassembled incorrectly — recognizable but WRONG.

DATA MOSHING (affecting the lower face and neck, 70-85% from top): Regions where the image data has been replaced with data from a different frame — creating blocks of incorrect color and shape that intrude into the face. These data-mosh blocks are rectangular (following JPEG compression block boundaries, typically 8x8 or 16x16 pixel blocks) and contain fragments of what appears to be a different image entirely: fragments of code, pieces of a city skyline, blocks of solid neon green — as though the hacked image is revealing something hidden beneath the face.

INTACT ZONES — THE SURVIVING FACE:

Not everything is corrupted. Strategic areas of the face remain pristine — photographically sharp and undamaged:
- ONE EYE (the left eye) remains perfectly intact — sharp, clear, staring directly at the viewer with unsettling clarity amid the surrounding chaos. This intact eye is the cover's focal point — the human presence persisting through the digital destruction.
- A strip of the mouth (one side of the lips) remains visible — just enough to suggest an expression that might be a smile or might be a grimace.
These intact fragments create the cover's psychological tension: a human face TRYING to exist inside corrupted data, partially succeeding.

TERMINAL TEXT OVERLAY:

Overlaid on the glitched image, lines of neon green (#00FF00) monospaced terminal text — the characteristic text of a command-line interface or hacking terminal:
- Scrolling text fragments visible in the upper portion: fragments of code, IP addresses, file paths, and command-line outputs. The text is partially transparent (60% opacity), allowing the corrupted face to show through.
- Key readable text fragments include: "DECRYPTING... 67% COMPLETE", "SUBJECT: [REDACTED]", "PROTOCOL: GLITCH-7", "WARNING: DATA INTEGRITY COMPROMISED"
- The text is NOT the focus — it adds atmosphere and theme without overwhelming the visual impact of the corrupted face.

SCAN LINES:

Very subtle horizontal scan lines cover the entire image — thin, evenly-spaced semi-transparent dark lines (#000000 at 10% opacity) that create the characteristic look of a CRT monitor or surveillance display. The scan lines add technological texture to the entire surface.

COLOR PALETTE — DIGITAL CORRUPTION:

- Base photograph: realistic skin tones and neutral background, rendered in standard photographic color
- Channel-shifted red: #FF0000 (pure red channel)
- Channel-shifted green: #00FF00 (pure green channel, also terminal text color)
- Channel-shifted blue: #0000FF (pure blue channel)
- Data-mosh neon green: #00FF00 — blocks of terminal green intruding into the face
- Corruption black: #000000 — dead pixels, scan lines, missing data
- Background dark: #0A0A0A — near-black background behind the face
The color palette is the palette of digital technology itself — RGB primaries, terminal green, and the black of dead data.

TEXT — MONOSPACED TERMINAL:

Title (positioned at 5-16% from top, partially overlapping the corrupted upper face):
"THE GLITCH" — in a monospaced terminal font (think Fira Code, Source Code Pro, or Consolas) in neon green (#00FF00) with a subtle glow effect — a soft green halo around each letter, as though displayed on a CRT monitor. Large, letter-spacing 0.15em.
"PROTOCOL" — on the next line, same font, same size, in stark white (#FFFFFF). The green-to-white shift suggests a terminal display switching modes.

A blinking cursor character (█) appears after "PROTOCOL" — a small detail that suggests the text is being typed in real-time on a live terminal.

Subtitle (positioned at 18% from top): "A CYBER THRILLER" — in smaller monospaced font in neon green (#00FF00), letter-spacing 0.3em.

Author name (positioned at 90-93% from top): "KATYA VOLKOV-OKAFOR" — in monospaced font in white (#FFFFFF), letter-spacing 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD:

Paranoid, technological, invasive — the feeling that your face is data, your identity is a file, and both can be corrupted, hacked, and reconstructed by someone who knows the protocol. The glitch art aesthetic transforms a simple portrait into a visual metaphor for digital vulnerability — we are all faces in a database, and databases can be broken.

THIS IS DIGITAL GLITCH ART. Pixel sorting, channel displacement, data moshing, scan-line corruption. The beauty is in the destruction — systematic, algorithmic, precise corruption that transforms a human face into abstract digital patterns while leaving just enough humanity visible to be disturbing.
