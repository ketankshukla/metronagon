## About Stripe Emails

**Can Stripe send a styled email matching the thank-you page?**

**No.** Stripe only sends a basic receipt email — it shows the amount charged, last 4 digits of the card, and your business name. You cannot customize the layout, add your requirements list, or style it to match your thank-you page.

**Your options for custom post-purchase emails:**

### Option A: Manual Email (Best for Now)
Send the onboarding email yourself from your business email within 24 hours of purchase. You already have the 25 email templates ready in the `emails/` folder. This is the simplest approach and adds a personal touch.

### Option B: Automated Custom Emails (Future Enhancement)
When you're ready to automate, you can set up:
1. **Resend** (https://resend.com) — Modern email API, free up to 3,000 emails/month
2. **Stripe Webhooks** — Stripe sends your server a notification when a payment succeeds
3. **Your server** receives the webhook, identifies the package, and sends a beautiful HTML email via Resend that matches the thank-you page exactly

This is a future enhancement. For now, the dynamic thank-you page shows all the requirements immediately after purchase, and you follow up with the email manually.

## Key Takeaway

You don't need a company to create anything for you. You need companies that do exactly **one thing well: put your existing work in front of the right eyeballs.** Start with Reedsy + Pinterest + email list (free), then layer on paid distribution as revenue grows.
