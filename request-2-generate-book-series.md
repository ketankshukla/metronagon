## What I need you to do:

1. **Read the entire prompt file** at `prompt-2-book-series-generator.md` — it has the full specification with exact formats, quality standards, and order of operations
2. **Start with series architecture** — fill in book-series-template.md, create master-arc-outline.md, create chapter outlines for every book
3. **Write every chapter of every book** — full-length, no shortcuts, hitting the word count minimums specified in the prompt file
4. **Create all front matter and back matter** for every book — copyright, dedication, epigraph, genre-specific files, about the author, also by, author's note, connect, review request
5. **Create all chapter summaries and book summaries** for every book
6. **Create all image prompts** — ultra-detailed photorealistic ebook cover prompts (60-80+ lines each), series logo prompt, paperback wrap prompts, box set prompts, social media prompts, character portrait prompts (fiction), YouTube thumbnail prompts. Follow the exact format shown in the prompt file — every prompt must include the anti-painterly directive, exact pixel dimensions, text placement percentages, and material-specific descriptions
7. **Create all marketing materials** — book blurbs, KDP descriptions (HTML formatted), series description, video scripts, HeyGen trailer spec, categories and keywords
8. **Populate the website data** — fill in src/data/books.ts with all book and chapter data, characters.ts if fiction, update layout.tsx metadata
9. **Organize Amazon production files** — fill in amazon-publishing-template.md, create organized files in amazon-production/

Work through the books sequentially (Book 1 first, then 2, etc.) to maintain cross-book continuity. The prompt file specifies the exact order of operations — follow it. Do not skip any files or write short chapters.
