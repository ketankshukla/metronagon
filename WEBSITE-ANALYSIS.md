# Metronagon Media — Detailed Website Analysis & Improvement Suggestions

## Context

Metronagon Media is a book cover design and publishing services business owned by Ketan Shukla, built on the credibility of 22 self-published books across 3 complete series. The website (metronagon.com) is a Next.js 16 site with Stripe embedded checkout, dark luxury aesthetic (gold on black), and 7 pages: Home, Services, Examples, Testimonials, Blog, About, and Checkout/Thank-You flow. The business is in its launch phase, targeting indie authors and self-publishers.

---

## Part 1: What the Website Does Well

1. **Credibility story is genuine and compelling** — 22 published books, 3 complete series, 30+ character portraits. This is rare in the cover design space and is your strongest differentiator.
2. **Visual portfolio is extensive** — 100+ example covers across 12 genres, a full 32-page children's book, and real series branding work. The proof is tangible.
3. **End-to-end checkout flow works** — Stripe embedded checkout keeps users on-site, the thank-you page dynamically shows package-specific requirements checklists. This is more polished than most competitors at this stage.
4. **Blog content is substantive** — 8 posts covering process, design principles, and case studies. These double as SEO content and trust-builders.
5. **Dark + gold aesthetic is distinctive** — It reads as premium and stands out from the typical white/light designer portfolios.
6. **Email templates are thorough** — 25 post-purchase onboarding emails ready to go, each tailored to the specific package ordered.
7. **Social media content is pre-built** — 53 tweets, 6 video scripts with per-platform upload guides, and a comprehensive social strategy document.

---

## Part 2: Critical Issues to Address

### 2.1 Testimonials Are Self-Referential -- DONE

All 4 testimonials are from Ketan Shukla about his own work. While the work is real, having the business owner as the only testimonial source undermines credibility. A potential client will notice immediately that the reviewer and the service provider are the same person.

**Suggestions:**

1. Remove the testimonials page entirely until you have real client testimonials, OR
2. Reframe the page as "Portfolio Case Studies" — describe the same projects but as case studies ("Here's how we built a 12-book fantasy series brand") rather than fake third-party reviews. This is honest and still demonstrates competence.

**Status:** Both suggestions implemented. Page rewritten as Portfolio Case Studies with 4 honest case studies (Aztec 12-book series, Repetition 5-book series, Reality 5-book series, Children's picture book). Nav labels updated to "Case Studies" in Header and Footer. Commits: `14fcbb7`, `20058be`, `147e290`.

### 2.2 No Analytics -- DONE

There is zero tracking on the site — no Google Analytics, no Vercel Analytics, no Plausible, nothing. You cannot measure traffic, conversion rates, or which pages/packages attract attention. You're flying blind.

**Suggestions:**

1. Add Vercel Analytics (free on Hobby plan, one line of code)
2. Or add Plausible (privacy-friendly, ~$9/month)
3. At minimum track: page views, traffic sources, and checkout conversion rates

**Status:** Vercel Analytics installed (`@vercel/analytics`) and added to root layout. Tracks page views, traffic sources, and top pages automatically on Vercel deployment.

### 2.3 No Email Capture / Lead Generation

The only way a visitor can interact is by purchasing a package. There's no email signup, no newsletter, no lead magnet, no free resource download. Most visitors won't buy on first visit — you need a way to capture them for follow-up.

**Suggestions:**

1. Add an email capture form using Kit/ConvertKit (free up to 10K subscribers)
2. Create a lead magnet — "Free PDF: 7 Cover Design Mistakes That Kill Book Sales" would work well given your blog content
3. Place the signup CTA on the homepage and at the end of blog posts

### 2.4 No Social Proof Links -- DONE

The footer and header have no links to social media profiles (X/Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, TikTok, YouTube). The social content is pre-built in the repo but there's no way for site visitors to find your social presence.

**Suggestions:**

1. Add social media icons to the footer linking to your active profiles
2. Prioritize X, Instagram, Pinterest, and YouTube (whichever are active)

**Status:** X, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok icons added to footer with correct links. JSON-LD sameAs updated with all 4 social URLs. Commit: `b33dd83`.

### 2.5 Missing SEO Essentials -- DONE

1. No Open Graph tags (social sharing will show generic text/no image)
2. No Twitter Card meta tags
3. No structured data (JSON-LD for LocalBusiness, Service, etc.)
4. No sitemap.xml
5. No robots.txt
6. Several pages are missing unique meta descriptions (Examples, Blog, Checkout)

**Suggestions:**

1. Add OG/Twitter meta tags to every page (with your logo or a featured cover as the image)
2. Generate a sitemap.xml (Next.js supports this natively)
3. Add JSON-LD structured data for your services
4. Add a robots.txt file
5. Add unique meta descriptions to Examples, Blog, and Checkout pages

**Status:** All implemented. Global OG/Twitter cards with metadataBase, JSON-LD (ProfessionalService + WebSite), sitemap.ts (14 routes), robots.ts, layout.tsx metadata for examples/blog/checkout, noindex on checkout/thank-you, blog description fix. Commit: `65e2ae7`.

### 2.6 Contact Method is Buried -- DONE

The only contact information (`hello@metronagon.com`) appears once, at the very bottom of the services page. There's no dedicated contact page, no contact form, and no way for a potential client to ask a question before committing to a purchase.

**Suggestions:**

1. Add a visible contact email in the footer
2. Add a simple contact form or at minimum a prominent "Questions? Email us" section on the services page
3. Consider a dedicated /contact page with a form (Formspree or Resend integration)

**Status:** Email link added to footer with Mail icon. "Questions Before You Order?" section added to services page with email link. Commit: `71e9e1b`.

## Part 3: Package Refinement Suggestions

This is the core of your request. Here's a critical analysis of the current package structure and specific suggestions for refinement.

### 3.1 Overall Package Structure Assessment -- DONE

**Current state:** 5 service categories x 2-3 tiers each = 13 main packages, plus 11 revision items, 2 add-ons, and 1 retainer = 27 total Stripe products.

**Problem:** Too many choices for a new business with no client base yet. The paradox of choice applies here — a first-time visitor seeing 13 packages across 5 categories may feel overwhelmed. For a business just starting out, this is a lot of complexity to manage and explain.

**Status:** Restructured to 4 categories, 9 main packages. Series Architecture removed as standalone. Updates & Revisions collapsed into accordion. Commit: `5f80a8e`.

### 3.2 Specific Package Issues

#### 3.2.1 Ebook Cover Design — Pricing May Be Too Low -- DONE

1. $75 for a standard cover and $150 for premium is competitive but potentially undervalues your work. Your portfolio quality is significantly above what $75 cover designers typically deliver. On Reedsy, professional AI-assisted cover designers charge $200-$500+.
2. **Suggestion:** Consider raising Standard to $99-$125 and Premium to $200-$250. Your portfolio justifies it, and higher prices actually signal quality to authors who have been burned by cheap Fiverr covers. You can always run a "launch discount" to soften the transition.

**Status:** Standard raised to $99, Premium raised to $175. User needs to update Stripe products to match.

#### 3.2.2 Series Architecture & Planning — May Confuse the Target Audience -- DONE

1. This service (chapter outlines, continuity plans, book descriptions) is fundamentally different from cover design. It's a writing/planning service, not a visual design service. Mixing it with cover design may dilute your brand positioning as a visual creative studio.
2. Authors who need series planning typically work with developmental editors or book coaches, not cover designers.
3. **Suggestion A:** Remove it as a standalone offering and only include it in the Full Pipeline packages — this reduces your service categories from 5 to 4 and makes the Full Pipeline more compelling as the "everything" option.
4. **Suggestion B:** If you keep it standalone, make it very clear on the services page that this is a planning/content service, not a design service.

**Status:** Removed as standalone. Series planning is now only available through Full Pipeline packages. Footer link updated.

#### 3.2.3 Children's Picture Books — Pricing Gap is Large -- DONE

1. Standard ($500) to Premium ($1,000) is a 100% jump. The main differences are character design sheets, print-ready formatting, and an extra revision round.
2. **Suggestion A:** Add a middle tier around $700-$750 that includes print-ready formatting but not the full character design system.
3. **Suggestion B:** Adjust the Standard to include print-ready formatting (since most children's book authors want print) and raise it to $600, making the gap smaller.

**Status:** Added Plus tier at $750 between Standard ($500) and Premium ($1,000). Plus includes print-ready formatting, 2 revision rounds, and enhanced illustrations. Premium retains exclusive character design system and story text document. Grid updated to 3-column layout.

#### 3.2.4 Full Pipeline — Overlap Creates Confusion -- DONE

1. The Full Pipeline packages are positioned as "everything combined" but the savings vs. buying individual packages aren't clearly communicated. A potential client has to do mental math to figure out if the pipeline is a good deal.
2. **Critical issue:** Full Pipeline Standard ($900) costs MORE than buying Series Architecture Medium ($400) + Series Branding Standard ($450) = $850 separately. There's no incentive to buy the bundle.
3. **Suggestion A:** Add a "Save X%" or "Save $X" badge to each Full Pipeline tier showing the discount vs. buying separately.
4. **Suggestion B:** Lower the pipeline prices to be clearly below the sum-of-parts. For example: Starter $400 (saves $50), Standard $750-$800 (saves $50-$100), Premium $1,300-$1,400 (saves $100-$250).
5. **Suggestion C:** Or increase the individual service prices so the pipeline savings are real at the current pipeline price.

**Status:** Fixed. Starter $425 (Save $50), Standard $800 (Save $75), Premium $1,400 (Save $200). Green "Save $X" badges added to all Full Pipeline cards.

#### 3.2.5 Updates & Revisions — Too Granular for the Services Page -- DONE

1. 11 separate revision/update line items on the main services page is excessive. Most of these are relevant only to existing clients.
2. **Suggestion A:** Move the Updates & Revisions section to a separate "For Existing Clients" page.
3. **Suggestion B:** Collapse it behind an expandable/accordion section on the services page.
4. New visitors don't need to see "Children's Book — Page Edits ($25/page)" on their first visit. Keep the main services page focused on new client acquisition.

**Status:** Collapsed into expandable accordion. Hidden by default, click to expand. Label changed to "Already a client? Purchase updates to existing work."

#### 3.2.6 Series Expansion Retainer — Needs Better Positioning -- DONE

1. $150/quarter for up to 1 cover per month (3 per quarter) is an excellent deal — that's $50/cover vs. $75-$85 individually. But it's listed as a small add-on at the bottom of the page.
2. **Suggestion:** Give it more prominence, perhaps as a callout box after the Series Branding section: "Publishing regularly? Lock in covers at $50 each with our quarterly retainer."

**Status:** Retainer card now has gold border highlight (border-gold/30 bg-gold/[0.03]) and updated copy: "Publishing regularly? Lock in covers at $50 each."

### 3.3 Recommended Simplified Package Structure for Launch

Given that you're just starting and need to acquire your first clients, consider launching with a simplified structure and expanding later:

**Option A — Streamlined (Recommended for Launch)**

| #   | Category                 | Tiers                                            | Notes                                             |
| --- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Ebook Cover Design       | Standard ($99) / Premium ($175)                  | Raised prices, still competitive                  |
| 2   | Series Branding          | 3-book ($275) / 5-book ($475) / 8+ book ($800)   | Slightly raised, includes covers + logo + box set |
| 3   | Children's Picture Books | Standard ($500) / Premium ($1,000)               | Keep as-is, strong offering                       |
| 4   | Full Pipeline            | 3-book ($450) / 5-book ($800) / 8+ book ($1,400) | Priced below sum-of-parts to incentivize bundles  |

Additional changes:

1. Remove Series Architecture as a standalone service — fold it into the Full Pipeline only
2. Move Updates & Revisions to a separate page or collapsible section
3. Keep Rush Fee and Returning Client Discount as add-ons
4. This gives you 4 categories and 9 main packages instead of 5 categories and 13 packages — cleaner, easier to explain, easier to market

---

## Part 4: Website Improvement Suggestions

### 4.1 Homepage Improvements -- DONE

The homepage is minimal — logo, one headline, two buttons. Consider adding:

1. A few featured cover examples (3-4 best covers in a row) to immediately show quality
2. A brief "How It Works" section (the 4-step process currently only on the services page)
3. A trust indicator: "22 Published Books. 3 Complete Series. The Proof is the Portfolio."
4. An email signup CTA

**Status:** Trust indicator bar (22 books, 3 series, 100+ covers, 30+ portraits), 6 featured covers grid, How It Works 4-step section added. Hero description updated. Commit: `71e9e1b`.

### 4.2 Services Page Improvements -- DONE

1. Add anchor navigation at the top (jump links to each service category)
2. Add a "Compare Packages" summary table at the top so visitors can see all options at a glance
3. Add "Save X%" badges to Full Pipeline packages
4. Add a FAQ section addressing common questions (turnaround, revision process, file formats, etc.)
5. Make the contact email more prominent

**Status:** Anchor nav bar with 5 jump links (Covers, Branding, Children's, Full Pipeline, FAQ). FAQ section with 6 Q&As. "Questions Before You Order?" section with email. Save badges done previously. Commit: `71e9e1b`.

### 4.3 Examples Page Improvements -- DONE

1. Add a brief intro explaining these are all created with the same pipeline available to clients
2. Consider adding a "Before/After" or "Process" section showing concept to final for one cover
3. Add CTAs between genre sections ("Like these? Get started")

**Status:** Inline CTA banner appears after 5th genre section when browsing all covers. Hero already had intro text. Commit: `71e9e1b`.

### 4.4 About Page Improvements -- DONE

1. The portfolio site links (ketanshukla.com, aztec.ketanshukla.com, etc.) are good proof but open in the same tab — they should open in new tabs
2. Consider adding a photo or avatar of the founder (there's a `ketan-shukla.jpeg` in the portfolio folder that appears unused on the about page)

**Status:** External links already had target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer". Founder photo (96px circle) added to hero. Commit: `71e9e1b`.

### 4.5 Technical Improvements -- DONE

1. **Add a sitemap.xml** — critical for SEO indexing
2. **Add Open Graph images** — when someone shares a link on Twitter/Facebook, it should show a branded image, not nothing
3. **Add Vercel Analytics** — `npm i @vercel/analytics` and one import in the root layout
4. **Consider a contact form** — even a simple one that sends to your email via a service like Formspree or Resend
5. **Image optimization** — the example covers are served from `/public` as static files. Consider using Next.js `<Image>` component for automatic optimization (WebP, lazy loading, responsive sizing) if not already done everywhere
6. **Add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to external links** — security best practice

**Status:** Sitemap, OG, Analytics done in earlier tasks. External links already had correct attributes. Next.js `<Image>` already used throughout. Contact form deferred (requires third-party service).

---

## Part 5: Marketing Readiness Assessment

### 5.1 What's Ready

1. 53 tweets pre-written with images and alt text
2. 6 TikTok/Shorts video scripts fully produced
3. Per-platform upload guides for TikTok, YouTube, Facebook
4. Marketing strategy document with tiered spending recommendations
5. Blog content for SEO (8 substantive posts)

### 5.2 What's Missing

1. **No Reedsy profile** — identified as your #1 priority in marketing-strategy.md but not yet created
2. **No Pinterest Business account** — identified as #2 priority
3. **No email list infrastructure** — no Kit/ConvertKit setup, no lead magnet created
4. **No social media profiles linked from the website**
5. **No analytics to measure anything**

### 5.3 Recommended Immediate Marketing Actions

1. Set up Vercel Analytics on the site
2. Create profiles on Reedsy and Pinterest
3. Set up Kit (ConvertKit) with an email capture form on the site
4. Add social media links to the footer
5. Start posting the pre-built tweets (the launch sequence is already planned)
6. Upload the first 2-3 video scripts to TikTok/YouTube

---

## Part 6: Competitive Positioning Notes

### 6.1 Strongest Differentiator

Your strongest differentiator is that **you've used your own pipeline to publish 22 real books**. Most cover designers show client work or mockups. You show your own published, live-on-Amazon books. This is a trust signal that's hard to fake.

### 6.2 Messaging Tension

There's a tension in the messaging: the site positions itself as a "studio" or "team" ("We create," "We begin working") but it's a one-person operation. This is common and acceptable in the freelance/creative industry, but be aware that if a client expects a team and discovers it's one person, it could feel misleading.

**Suggestions:**

1. Lean into the personal brand ("I've published 22 books and now I'll do the same for yours"), OR
2. Commit fully to the studio framing — but don't mix them
3. The about page currently walks a middle line that could go either way

---

---

## Part 1: What the Site Does Well (Current State)

1. **SEO is fully implemented** — `metadataBase`, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, JSON-LD (`ProfessionalService` + `WebSite`), `sitemap.ts` (14 routes including all blog posts), `robots.ts` with correct disallow rules. All done.

12. **Checkout flow** — Stripe embedded checkout with package-specific thank-you page.

---

## Part 2: Issues & New Recommendations

### 2.1 — CRITICAL: OG Image Is the Logo (512×512), Not a Proper Social Preview

`layout.tsx` sets the OG image to `/portfolio/logo.png` at 512×512. The recommended size for social sharing is **1200×630px** (landscape). A square logo as the OG image will:

- Be cropped or letterboxed on Twitter/X (which expects 2:1 ratio)
- Look unprofessional compared to competitors when shared on LinkedIn or Facebook
- Miss the opportunity to show actual cover work in the preview

**Fix:** Create a 1200×630px branded image — ideally showing the Metronagon logo on the left and 3–4 of the best cover examples on the right, with the tagline "The Measure of Excellence." Save as `/public/og-image.jpg` and update `layout.tsx` to reference it with correct dimensions.

---

### 2.2 — CRITICAL: Blog Posts Are Stubs — No Actual Content

The blog page lists 8 posts with titles, excerpts, and slugs. But clicking any post links to `/blog/[slug]` — and there is a `[slug]/` directory but no actual page content has been read. If these are empty or placeholder pages, any visitor who clicks a blog post from Google search will land on a blank or 404 page. This is a serious SEO and credibility problem.

**Action needed:** Verify whether `/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` exists and has real content for all 8 slugs. If not, either write the content or remove the blog links until they do.

---

### 2.3 — HIGH: Pricing Has Increased Significantly — Verify Stripe Products Match

The original analysis noted prices like $99 (Standard cover) and $175 (Premium cover). The current services page shows $500 (Standard) and $750 (Premium) for covers — a 5× increase. Series Branding starts at $1,200. Full Pipeline starts at $1,800.

These are now **premium agency prices**, not freelancer prices. This is a legitimate positioning choice, but it means:

- The target client has shifted from individual indie authors to more serious/funded authors or small publishers
- The "22 published books" credibility story is even more important at these price points — clients paying $5,000 for a Full Pipeline Premium will research thoroughly
- The lack of real client testimonials is now a more significant trust gap at these prices

**Recommendations:**

1. Add a "Why These Prices?" section or FAQ entry explaining the value — what does $500 get you that a $75 Fiverr cover doesn't?
2. Consider adding a comparison table showing Metronagon vs. typical alternatives (Fiverr, Reedsy, etc.) on quality, turnaround, and consistency
3. At $1,800–$5,000 price points, a contact-first flow (rather than pay-first) may convert better — many clients at this level want to discuss before committing

---

### 2.4 — HIGH: No Real Client Testimonials Still

The Case Studies page shows Ketan's own work (Aztec, Repetition, Reality, Children's book). This is honest and correct. But at $500–$5,000 price points, potential clients will want to see that other people have paid for and been happy with this service. The absence of any external validation is the single biggest trust gap for a business at this stage.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Actively seek first clients at a discount** — offer 2–3 projects at 50% off in exchange for a detailed testimonial and permission to feature the work. One real client testimonial is worth more than any amount of portfolio work.
2. **Add a "First Client" or "Beta Client" offer** — a visible banner or section: "We're accepting 3 founding clients at 40% off. In exchange, we ask for an honest review." This turns the lack of testimonials into a feature.
3. **Add a Reedsy profile** — Reedsy has a built-in review system and is where serious indie authors look for cover designers. A Reedsy profile with even 1–2 reviews is powerful social proof.

---

### 2.5 — HIGH: "See Our Work" and "View Services" Buttons Are Identical Style on Homepage

On the homepage hero, both CTAs ("View Services" and "See Our Work") use the exact same gold button style. Standard UX practice is to have a **primary CTA** (gold/filled) and a **secondary CTA** (outlined/ghost). When both buttons look the same, neither stands out.

**Fix:** Make "View Services" the primary (gold filled, as it is now) and "See Our Work" the secondary (outlined with gold border, transparent background). This creates a clear visual hierarchy and guides the eye to the higher-converting action.

---

### 2.6 — HIGH: Services Page Uses `"use client"` But Exports `Metadata`

`src/app/services/page.tsx` has both `"use client"` at the top (line 1) and `import type { Metadata } from "next"` with a `metadata` export (lines 3–4). **This is invalid in Next.js App Router** — Client Components cannot export metadata. The metadata export will be silently ignored, meaning the services page has no SEO title or description despite the code appearing to set one.

**Fix:** Extract the accordion (`UpdatesAccordion`) into a separate `"use client"` component file, then make `services/page.tsx` a Server Component (remove `"use client"`) so the `metadata` export works correctly.

---

### 2.7 — MEDIUM: No Email Capture / Lead Generation

The only conversion path is: visit → pay. There is no email signup, no lead magnet, no newsletter. Most visitors — especially at $500–$5,000 price points — will not buy on first visit. They need multiple touchpoints.

**Recommendations:**

1. Add a free lead magnet: "Free PDF: 7 Cover Design Mistakes That Kill Book Sales" — this is directly supported by the existing blog content
2. Add an email capture form using Kit/ConvertKit (free up to 10K subscribers) on the homepage and at the end of blog posts
3. A simple "Get our free cover design checklist" opt-in would capture warm leads who aren't ready to buy yet

---

### 2.8 — MEDIUM: No Reedsy Profile

Reedsy is the #1 marketplace where serious indie authors find cover designers. It has a built-in review system, vetted professional status, and direct client leads. It was identified as the #1 marketing priority in the original analysis and still hasn't been actioned.

**This is the highest-ROI marketing action available.** A Reedsy profile with the existing portfolio would immediately put Metronagon in front of authors actively looking to hire.

### 2.9 — MEDIUM: FAQ Has a Pricing Inconsistency

The FAQ answer for "Can I expand my series later?" says: _"Or purchase individual Add New Book Cover updates ($85) anytime."_ But the Updates & Revisions accordion lists "Add New Book Cover" at **$400**. The FAQ is wrong by a factor of ~5×.

**Fix:** Update the FAQ answer to say $400, or update the Updates section to $85 — whichever is the intended price.

### 2.10 — MEDIUM: "How It Works" Section Appears Twice

The "How It Works" 4-step section appears on both the **homepage** and the **services page**. The content is nearly identical. On the services page it makes sense (it's contextually relevant to the purchase flow). On the homepage it's redundant — a visitor who goes from homepage to services sees it twice within the same session.

**Fix:** Remove "How It Works" from the homepage and keep it only on the services page. Replace it on the homepage with something that adds new information — e.g., a "What You Get" visual breakdown or a featured before/after.

### 2.11 — LOW: Homepage Has Two Gold Buttons in Hero That Both Go to `/services`

Looking at the homepage hero code: the "View Services" button links to `/services` and the "See Our Work" button links to `/examples`. That's correct. But the styling issue (2.5 above) makes them look like duplicates.

### 2.12 — LOW: Footer Copyright Says "Metronagon" Not "Metronagon Media"

The footer copyright line reads `© 2026 Metronagon. All rights reserved.` but the brand name used everywhere else is "Metronagon Media." Minor inconsistency — should be consistent.

### 2.13 — LOW: No Pinterest Business Account

Pinterest is the #2 marketing priority from the original analysis (after Reedsy) and still hasn't been actioned. Book cover designers do extremely well on Pinterest — it's a visual discovery platform where authors actively search for cover inspiration and find designers.
