CAPTION (copy-paste this entire block into the caption field):
We didn't start Metronagon to sell you something. We started it because we built something — and realized other authors needed it too. 22 books. 3 series. Every cover, every character, every visual element — built from scratch. The proof isn't a promise. It's a portfolio. #SmallBusiness #BuildInPublic #IndieAuthor #BookTok #Entrepreneur #CreativeBusiness #AIArt #SelfPublishing #AuthorTok #StartupStory #OriginStory #WritingCommunity #BookDesign #IndiePublishing #Metronagon
