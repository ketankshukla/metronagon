CAPTION (copy-paste this entire block into the caption field):
Most people don't believe AI can create a children's picture book this good. 32 pages. Consistent characters on every single page. Same face, same proportions, page 1 through page 32. That's the hardest thing to achieve — and we've solved it. #ChildrensBook #PictureBook #BookTok #KidLit #AIIllustration #ChildrensAuthor #KidsBooks #BookDesign #AIArt #SelfPublishing #ChildrensIllustration #IndieAuthor #WritingCommunity #PictureBookArt #Metronagon
