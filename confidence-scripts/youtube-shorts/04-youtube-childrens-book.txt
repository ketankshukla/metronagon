TITLE (copy-paste this):
AI-Illustrated Children's Book. 32 Pages. Every Character Consistent. | Metronagon

DESCRIPTION (copy-paste this):
Most people don't believe AI can create a children's picture book this good. So let us just show you.

Thirty-two pages. Every single one fully illustrated. Rich, vibrant, Pixar-quality artwork with consistent lighting, consistent color palettes, and a warmth that jumps off the page.

The main character looks the same on every single page. Same face. Same proportions. Same outfit. Page one through page thirty-two. That's the hardest thing to achieve with AI — and we've solved it.
