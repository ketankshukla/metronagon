TITLE (copy-paste this):
We Published 22 Books. Then Turned the Process Into a Business. | Metronagon

DESCRIPTION (copy-paste this):
We didn't start Metronagon to sell you something. We started it because we built something — and realized other authors needed it too.

It began with one book. Then twelve. A complete fantasy series. Then a self-improvement series. A philosophical essay series. A children's picture book. Four completely different visual languages — same pipeline, same standard.

That's Metronagon. Not a promise of what we could do — a portfolio of what we've already done. Every cover on our site is real. Every series is published. Every image was created with the exact same process we use for your project.
