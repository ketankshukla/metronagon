TITLE (copy-paste this):
5 Layers. 1 Pipeline. Everything Your Book Series Needs. | Metronagon

DESCRIPTION (copy-paste this):
Most authors hire five different freelancers to launch a series. You only need one.

Layer 1: Covers — photorealistic, genre-accurate, Amazon-ready.
Layer 2: Branding — series logos, style guides, visual identity systems.
Layer 3: Series Architecture — chapter outlines, continuity plans, cross-book arc design.
Layer 4: Character Design — photorealistic portraits with consistent style.
Layer 5: Children's Books — thirty-two illustrated pages, print-ready.

Stack them all together — that's the Full Pipeline. One partner, one vision, one delivery.
