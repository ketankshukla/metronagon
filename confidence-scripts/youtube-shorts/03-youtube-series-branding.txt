TITLE (copy-paste this):
One Cover Is Easy. A 12-Book Series? That's a System. | Metronagon

DESCRIPTION (copy-paste this):
Here's the difference between a book and a book series that sells.

Any designer can make you one cover. But what happens when you publish book two? Book three? If they don't match — your series looks amateur.

We built a system: 12 books, same color grading, same typography, same lighting, same compositional language. Three completely different series — all built with the same pipeline.

SERIES WE'VE BUILT:
- Aztec Apocalypse: 12-book fantasy series
- Repetition: 5-book self-improvement series
- Reality: 5-book philosophical essay series
