## Avatar Settings

- **Avatar type:** Professional male presenter (or custom Ketan avatar)
- **Appearance time:** 0:00–0:05 (opening) and 0:50–0:60 (closing)
- **Attire:** Dark crew neck or casual blazer — slightly warmer than the other scripts
- **Expression:** Opening: "you won't believe this" — slightly playful, inviting. Closing: warm, proud, genuine

## Voice Settings

- **Voice style:** Warmer than the other scripts — still authoritative but with genuine enthusiasm and wonder
- **Pace:** ~148 words per minute — the narration is slightly longer, so pace needs to be measured but natural
- **Emphasis words:** "Pixar-quality," "every single page," "same face, same proportions," "hardest thing to achieve," "we've solved it," "five hundred dollars"
- **Pauses:** Brief pause after "So let me just show you" (0:05), dramatic beat after "we've solved it" (0:33), pause at 0:48–0:50
- **Tone:** More emotional warmth than the other scripts — this is about creating something beautiful for someone's child

## Background

- **Talking head sections:** Solid deep black (#0a0a0a)
- **Image sections:** Children's pages fill the entire screen — their vibrant colors ARE the background
- **Contrast note:** The shift from dark presenter to colorful illustrations creates a powerful visual impact
