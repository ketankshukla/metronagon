Metronagon Confidence Scripts

60-second elevator pitches and social media short scripts designed for HeyGen video generation. Each script is crafted with Hollywood-style cinematic narration energy, orchestral music direction, and specific portfolio image sequences.

Folder Structure

Each script has 3 files + its own image folder:

  XX-script-name.txt              Full production document with image timing, visual direction, music cues, and narration
  XX-script-name-heygen-metadata.txt   HeyGen-specific settings: avatar, voice, background, music, and image overlay instructions
  XX-script-name-plain.txt        Clean narration text only — copy-paste directly into HeyGen's script field
  XX-images/                      Folder containing ONLY the images that script uses — drag and drop the whole folder into HeyGen

No paths needed — just the filename as listed in each script.

Music Direction (All Scripts)

  - Style: Orchestral cinematic — think Hans Zimmer "Interstellar" or "Inception" at 30% volume
  - Narration-to-music ratio: Narration at 100% volume, music at 25-30% volume
  - Music should feel: Inspiring, building, confident — NOT aggressive, NOT sad, NOT generic corporate
  - Avoid: Stock ukulele, whistling, clapping tracks. This is premium. The music must match.

HeyGen General Settings

  - Avatar: Professional male presenter or your own custom avatar
  - Voice: Deep, confident, measured pace — think movie trailer narrator but conversational
  - Background: Solid dark (#0a0a0a) or subtle dark gradient
  - Aspect ratio: 9:16 portrait (1080x1920) — all videos
  - Captions: Enable auto-captions with gold (#d4af37) text on dark background
