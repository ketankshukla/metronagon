Music Direction (All Scripts)

  - Style: Orchestral cinematic — think Hans Zimmer "Interstellar" or "Inception" at 30% volume
  - Narration-to-music ratio: Narration at 100% volume, music at 25-30% volume
  - Music should feel: Inspiring, building, confident — NOT aggressive, NOT sad, NOT generic corporate
  - Avoid: Stock ukulele, whistling, clapping tracks. This is premium. The music must match.

HeyGen General Settings

  - Avatar: Professional male presenter or your own custom avatar
