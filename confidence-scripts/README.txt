Music Direction (All Scripts)

  - Style: Orchestral cinematic — think Hans Zimmer "Interstellar" or "Inception" at 30% volume
  - Narration-to-music ratio: Narration at 100% volume, music at 25-30% volume
  - Music should feel: Inspiring, building, confident — NOT aggressive, NOT sad, NOT generic corporate
  - Avoid: Stock ukulele, whistling, clapping tracks. This is premium. The music must match.

HeyGen General Settings

  - Avatar: Professional male presenter or your own custom avatar
  - Voice: Deep, confident, measured pace — think movie trailer narrator but conversational
  - Background: Solid dark (#0a0a0a) or subtle dark gradient
  - Aspect ratio: 9:16 for TikTok/Shorts, 16:9 for YouTube/Facebook
  - Captions: Enable auto-captions with gold (#d4af37) text on dark background
