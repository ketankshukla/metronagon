METRONAGON VIDEO SCRIPT 04: THE CHILDREN'S BOOK MAGIC
=======================================================

VIDEO SPECIFICATIONS

  Duration: 60 seconds
  Aspect Ratio: 9:16 portrait (1080x1920)
  Resolution: 1080p minimum
  Frame Rate: 30fps
  Platform: Facebook / YouTube Shorts / Instagram Reels
  Purpose: Showcase Pixar-quality children's book illustration capability — the "wow we didn't know AI could do that" moment
  Tone: Warm, wonder-filled, but still professional — like a Pixar "making of" featurette narrator

HEYGEN AVATAR SETTINGS

  Avatar type: Professional male presenter (or custom Ketan avatar)
  Appearance time: 0:00-0:05 (opening) and 0:50-0:60 (closing)
  Attire: Dark crew neck or casual blazer — slightly warmer than the other scripts
  Expression: Opening: "you won't believe this" — slightly playful, inviting. Closing: warm, proud, genuine

HEYGEN VOICE SETTINGS

  Voice style: Warmer than the other scripts — still authoritative but with genuine enthusiasm and wonder
  Pace: ~148 words per minute — the narration is slightly longer, so pace needs to be measured but natural
  Emphasis words: "Pixar-quality," "every single page," "same face, same proportions," "hardest thing to achieve," "we've solved it," "five hundred dollars"
  Pauses: Brief pause after "So let us just show you" (0:05), dramatic beat after "we've solved it" (0:33), pause at 0:48-0:50
  Tone: More emotional warmth than the other scripts — this is about creating something beautiful for someone's child

HEYGEN BACKGROUND

  Talking head sections: Solid deep black (#0a0a0a)
  Image sections: Children's pages fill the entire screen — their vibrant colors ARE the background
  Contrast note: The shift from dark presenter to colorful illustrations creates a powerful visual impact

HEYGEN CAPTIONS

  Enable: Yes
  Font color: Gold (#d4af37)
  Background: Semi-transparent black
  Position: Bottom third
  Note: During the colorful illustration pages, captions provide important contrast against the vibrant backgrounds

HEYGEN MUSIC

  Category: "Emotional" or "Inspirational Orchestral" — warm, NOT dark or intense
  Style: Warm orchestral with a touch of whimsy — strings carry the melody, light woodwinds (flute, clarinet) add color, gentle harp arpeggios underneath. NOT childish or cartoonish — think Pixar's "Up" opening sequence score. Beautiful, emotional, refined.
  Volume: 25% during talking head, 35% during illustration pages (the warmth of the music enhances the colorful visuals)
  Key moments: Harp entrance at 0:05 (first page reveal), emotional string swell at 0:37 (montage grid), warm resolution at 0:50
  Reference: Michael Giacchino "Married Life" (Up) at very low volume — that bittersweet warmth and wonder
  Absolutely NOT: No music box tinkling, no nursery rhyme melodies, no generic "kids" music. This is premium children's illustration, not a toy commercial.

PLATFORM NOTES

  Facebook: This is the BEST script for Facebook — parents and grandparents are the audience. Target: parents, gift-givers, teachers

PLAIN NARRATION SCRIPT
=======================================================
(Copy-paste this entire block into HeyGen's script field)

Most people don't believe us when we tell them AI can create a children's picture book this good. So let us just show you.

Thirty-two pages. Every single one fully illustrated. Rich, vibrant, Pixar-quality artwork with consistent lighting, consistent color palettes, and a warmth that jumps off the page.

But here's what makes this truly difficult — and truly special. The main character looks the same on every single page. Same face. Same proportions. Same outfit. Page one through page thirty-two. That kind of character consistency is the hardest thing to achieve with AI — and we've solved it.

Story written. Pages illustrated. PDF assembled and print-ready. One complete package.

And this isn't our only style. The same pipeline that creates children's illustrations also produces cinematic fantasy covers and photorealistic character portraits. The range is the proof.

Children's picture books. Starting at five hundred dollars. From concept to print-ready in five business days. Metronagon dot com.
