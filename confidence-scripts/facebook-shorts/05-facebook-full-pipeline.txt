POST DETAILS
-------------

CAPTION (copy-paste this):
Most authors hire 5 different freelancers to launch a series. You only need one.

Layer 1: Covers — photorealistic, genre-accurate, Amazon-ready
Layer 2: Branding — series logos, style guides, visual identity systems
Layer 3: Series Architecture — chapter outlines, continuity plans, cross-book arc design
Layer 4: Character Design — photorealistic portraits with consistent style
Layer 5: Children's Books — 32 illustrated pages, consistent characters, print-ready

Stack them all together — that's the Full Pipeline. One partner, one vision, one delivery. No coordination headaches. No style mismatches.

We've done it 3 times. 3 different genres. 3 complete series. 22 books. The proof isn't a promise — it's a portfolio.
