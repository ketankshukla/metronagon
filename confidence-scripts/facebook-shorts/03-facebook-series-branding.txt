CAPTION (copy-paste this):
Here's the difference between a book and a book series that sells.

Any designer can make you one cover. But what happens when you publish book two? Book three? If the fonts are different, the lighting is off, the style shifts — your series looks amateur.

This is what consistency looks like. Twelve books. Same color grading. Same typography system. Same lighting direction. A reader sees one — they recognize the rest instantly. That's not luck. That's a system.

We don't design covers — we build series brands.

Visit metronagon.com to see how we can brand your series.
