------------------------------

1. Go to your Metronagon Facebook Page
2. Click "Reels" in the left sidebar (or click Create > Reel)
3. Click "Upload video" and select the exported video file
4. The video should be 9:16 portrait, 60 seconds — Facebook Reels accepts this natively

   Do NOT add Facebook music over the top

7. ADD TEXT/EFFECTS (optional):
   - You can add a text overlay at the start: "What does Metronagon do?"
   - Keep it clean and professional — avoid stickers or excessive effects

8. EDIT COVER:
