POST DETAILS

CAPTION (copy-paste this):
We didn't start Metronagon to sell you something. We started it because we built something — and realized other authors needed it too.

It began with one book. Then twelve. A complete fantasy series — every cover, every character, every visual element designed and generated through a pipeline we built from scratch.

Then we did it again. A self-improvement series. A philosophical essay series. A children's picture book. Four completely different visual languages — same pipeline, same standard, same obsessive attention to detail.

22 books. 3 complete series. And then we looked at what we'd built and thought — this isn't just our workflow. This is a service.

That's Metronagon. Not a promise of what we could do — a portfolio of what we've already done.

Visit metronagon.com — every cover on our site is real. Every series is published.
