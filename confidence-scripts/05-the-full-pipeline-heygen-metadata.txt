HeyGen Metadata — Script 05: The Full Pipeline Power

AVATAR SETTINGS

  - Avatar type: Professional male presenter (or custom Ketan avatar)
  - Appearance time: 0:00-0:04 (opening) and 0:50-0:60 (closing)
  - Attire: Dark blazer, sharp — this is the most "business" script of the six
  - Expression: Opening: decisive, "listen up" energy. Closing: confident, commanding close

VOICE SETTINGS

  - Voice style: Structured and precise — each layer delivered with clear articulation, like building blocks snapping together
  - Pace: ~160 words per minute — this script is information-dense, needs a slightly faster clip while maintaining clarity
  - Emphasis words: "one," "layer one/two/three/four/five," "Full Pipeline," "one partner, one vision, one delivery," "four hundred dollars," "delivered in days"
  - Pauses: Very brief pauses between layers — just enough for the text overlay to land, then immediately into the next. Longer pause at 0:36 before "Stack them all together"
  - Tone: Build energy with each layer — start controlled, end powerful

BACKGROUND

  - Talking head sections: Solid deep black (#0a0a0a)
  - Layer reveals: Dark background with text overlays and images
  - Text overlays: Gold (#d4af37) Cinzel or bold sans-serif, large, centered — "LAYER 1: COVERS" etc.

MUSIC

  - Category: "Epic Orchestral" or "Cinematic Build"
  - Volume: 25% talking head, 30% during layers, 40% hit at 0:36
  - Critical: Must have percussive hits aligning with layer reveals — snare or taiko drum accent at each transition
  - Build: Music complexity should match visual complexity — more instruments with each layer

CAPTIONS

  - Enable: Yes
  - Font color: Gold (#d4af37)
  - Background: Semi-transparent black
  - Position: Bottom third
  - Note: Layer labels ("LAYER 1: COVERS" etc.) are separate text overlays, not captions

EXPORT SETTINGS

  - Resolution: 1080p

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC NOTES

  - YouTube Shorts: Title: "5 layers. 1 pipeline. Everything your book series needs."
  - Facebook: Great for targeting indie author groups — the "you only need one" message resonates with overwhelmed self-publishers
  - TikTok: Hashtags: #SelfPublishing #BookSeries #IndieAuthor #BookTok #BookCoverDesign #AuthorLife #WritingCommunity
