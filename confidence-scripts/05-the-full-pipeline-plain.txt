Most authors hire five different freelancers to launch a series. You only need one.

Layer one — covers. Photorealistic, genre-accurate, Amazon-ready. Three concepts, one polished final. Starting at seventy-five dollars.

Layer two — branding. Series logos, style guides, visual identity systems that make every book in your series unmistakably part of the same family.

Layer three — series architecture. Chapter outlines, continuity plans, book descriptions, cross-book arc design. The blueprint before the build.

Layer four — character design. Photorealistic portraits with consistent style. Thirty unique characters across one series — every one recognizable, every one distinct.

Layer five — children's picture books. Thirty-two illustrated pages, consistent characters, print-ready PDF. Complete.

Stack them all together — that's the Full Pipeline. Covers, branding, planning, illustration — one partner, one vision, one delivery. No coordination headaches. No style mismatches.

We've done it three times. Three different genres. Three complete series. Twenty-two books. The proof isn't a promise — it's a portfolio.

Full Pipeline packages start at four hundred dollars. Everything your series needs — delivered in days. Metronagon dot com.
