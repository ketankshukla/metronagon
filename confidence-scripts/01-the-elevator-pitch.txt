MUSIC DIRECTION

  - Track style: Building orchestral — starts with soft strings, adds brass and percussion at 0:22, reaches subtle crescendo at 0:46, resolves warmly at 0:52
  - Volume: 25% of narration volume throughout
  - Feel: The feeling of watching a prestige film trailer — gravitas without aggression
  - Reference: Hans Zimmer "Time" (Inception) at very low volume — that sweeping, building, emotional gravitas

NARRATION SCRIPT (with timing)

[0:00-0:03] (logo on screen)
(Beat of silence as logo appears)

[0:03-0:12]
"At Metronagon Media, we create professional book covers, series branding, and complete publishing packages for authors — powered by AI, refined by craft."

[0:12-0:22]
"We built this business the only way we trust — by doing it ourselves first. Twenty-two published books. Three complete series. Every single cover, every character portrait, every logo — created with the same pipeline we now offer as a service."

[0:22-0:34]
"We're talking photorealistic fantasy covers. Cinematic character portraits. Cohesive series branding that makes twelve books look like they belong on the same shelf. And Pixar-quality children's book illustrations — thirty-two pages, consistent characters, assembled and print-ready."

[0:34-0:46]
"What makes us different? We don't just design a cover. We think in series. Logos, box sets, panoramic art, YouTube thumbnails, style guides — everything an author needs to look like a professional publishing house, not a solo operation."

[0:46-0:58]
"Covers start at seventy-five dollars. Full series pipelines go up to fifteen hundred. Everything is delivered in days, not weeks. The proof is the portfolio — twenty-two books, three series, all live, all real."

[0:58-0:60]
"Metronagon dot com. The measure of excellence."
