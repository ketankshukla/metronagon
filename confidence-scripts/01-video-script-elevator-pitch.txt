SHOT-BY-SHOT PRODUCTION TIMELINE
================================================

DISPLAY RULES FOR 9:16 PORTRAIT FORMAT:
  - Portrait images (book covers, character portraits): ONE per scene, full screen
  - Square images (children's book pages): ONE per scene, centered, dark bars top/bottom
  - Landscape images (panoramics, box sets): TWO stacked vertically, both fully visible, no cropping
  - No watermarks or logo overlays during avatar/narration scenes
  - No side-by-side images — every image gets the full frame

Each shot specifies exactly what is on screen, the transition into and out of it,
and what the narrator is saying. "AVATAR" means the AI presenter is visible.
"IMAGE" means the avatar is hidden and a full-screen image is shown.

PLAIN NARRATION SCRIPT
================================================
(Copy-paste this entire block into HeyGen's script field)

At Metronagon Media, we create professional book covers, series branding, and complete publishing packages for authors — powered by AI, refined by craft.

We built this business the only way we trust — by doing it ourselves first. Twenty-two published books. Three complete series. Every single cover, every character portrait, every logo — created with the same pipeline we now offer as a service.

We're talking photorealistic fantasy covers. Cinematic character portraits. Cohesive series branding that makes twelve books look like they belong on the same shelf. And Pixar-quality children's book illustrations — thirty-two pages, consistent characters, assembled and print-ready.

What makes us different? We don't just design a cover. We think in series. Logos, box sets, panoramic art, YouTube thumbnails, style guides — everything an author needs to look like a professional publishing house, not a solo operation.

Everything is delivered in days, not weeks. The proof is the portfolio — twenty-two books, three series, all live, all real. Visit us at Metronagon dot com.
