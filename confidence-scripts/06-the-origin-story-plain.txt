I didn't start Metronagon to sell you something. I started it because I built something — and realized other authors needed it too.

It began with one book. Then two. Then twelve. A complete fantasy series — every cover, every character, every visual element designed and generated through a pipeline I built from scratch.

Thirty character portraits, each one distinct, each one consistent with the world. A series logo. Box set art. Panoramic covers. Not outsourced. Not templated. Built.

Then I did it again. A self-improvement series. A philosophical essay series. A children's picture book. Four completely different visual languages — same pipeline, same standard, same obsessive attention to detail.

Twenty-two books. Three complete series. Four live portfolio websites. Thumbnails, style guides, brand systems. And then I looked at what I'd built and thought — this isn't just my workflow. This is a service.

That's Metronagon. Not a promise of what we could do — a portfolio of what we've already done. Every cover on our site is real. Every series is published. Every image was created with the exact same process we use for your project.

Metronagon dot com. The measure of excellence.
