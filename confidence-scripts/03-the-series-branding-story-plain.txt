Here's the difference between a book and a book series that sells.

Any designer can make you one cover. But what happens when you publish book two? Book three? If they don't match — if the fonts are different, the lighting is off, the style shifts — your series looks amateur.

This is what consistency looks like. Twelve books. Same color grading. Same typography system. Same lighting direction. Same compositional language. A reader sees one — they recognize the rest instantly. That's not luck. That's a system.

A series logo that anchors the brand. A box set cover that sells all twelve as one premium product.

Different genre? Different mood? Same precision. Self-improvement series — authoritative, clean, powerful. Philosophical essays — contemplative, restrained, intellectual. Three completely different visual languages — all built with the same pipeline.

This is what we do. We don't design covers — we build series brands. Starting at two-fifty. Metronagon dot com.
