METRONAGON VIDEO SCRIPT 05: THE FULL PIPELINE POWER
=====================================================

VIDEO SPECIFICATIONS

  Duration: 60 seconds
  Aspect Ratio: 9:16 portrait (1080x1920)
  Resolution: 1080p minimum
  Frame Rate: 30fps
  Platform: YouTube Shorts / Facebook
  Purpose: Showcase the end-to-end capability — covers + branding + series architecture + children's books — all from one source. The "why hire five freelancers when you can hire one" pitch.
  Tone: Commanding, structured, business-savvy — like a CEO presenting quarterly results, but with creative fire

HEYGEN AVATAR SETTINGS

  Avatar type: Professional male presenter (or custom Ketan avatar)
  Appearance time: 0:00-0:04 (opening) and 0:50-0:60 (closing)
  Attire: Dark blazer, sharp — this is the most "business" script of the six
  Expression: Opening: decisive, "listen up" energy. Closing: confident, commanding close

HEYGEN VOICE SETTINGS

  Voice style: Structured and precise — each layer delivered with clear articulation, like building blocks snapping together
  Pace: ~160 words per minute — this script is information-dense, needs a slightly faster clip while maintaining clarity
  Emphasis words: "one," "layer one/two/three/four/five," "Full Pipeline," "one partner, one vision, one delivery," "four hundred dollars," "delivered in days"
  Pauses: Very brief pauses between layers — just enough for the text overlay to land, then immediately into the next. Longer pause at 0:36 before "Stack them all together"
  Tone: Build energy with each layer — start controlled, end powerful

HEYGEN BACKGROUND

  Talking head sections: Solid deep black (#0a0a0a)
  Layer reveals: Dark background with text overlays and images
  Text overlays: Gold (#d4af37) Cinzel or bold sans-serif, large, centered — "LAYER 1: COVERS" etc.

HEYGEN CAPTIONS

  Enable: Yes
  Font color: Gold (#d4af37)
  Background: Semi-transparent black
  Position: Bottom third
  Note: Layer labels ("LAYER 1: COVERS" etc.) are separate text overlays, not captions

HEYGEN MUSIC

  Category: "Epic Orchestral" or "Cinematic Build"
  Style: Precise, rhythmic orchestral — think "assembling a machine." Staccato strings mark each layer reveal, building in complexity as layers stack. Full orchestral power at 0:36 ("THE FULL PIPELINE" moment), then controlled confidence through the close.
  Volume: 25% during talking head, 30% during layer reveals, brief 40% hit at 0:36
  Key moments: Percussion snap at each "LAYER" text reveal (0:04, 0:10, 0:16, 0:22, 0:30), full brass hit at 0:36, warm resolution at 0:50
  Reference: Hans Zimmer "Mombasa" (Inception) at low volume — that relentless, building, precise energy
  Build: Music complexity should match visual complexity — more instruments with each layer
  Critical: Must have percussive hits aligning with layer reveals — snare or taiko drum accent at each transition

PLATFORM NOTES

  YouTube Shorts: Title: "5 layers. 1 pipeline. Everything your book series needs."
  Facebook: Great for targeting indie author groups — the "you only need one" message resonates with overwhelmed self-publishers
  TikTok: Hashtags: #SelfPublishing #BookSeries #IndieAuthor #BookTok #BookCoverDesign #AuthorLife #WritingCommunity

PLAIN NARRATION SCRIPT
=====================================================
(Copy-paste this entire block into HeyGen's script field)

Most authors hire five different freelancers to launch a series. You only need one.

Layer one — covers. Photorealistic, genre-accurate, Amazon-ready. Three concepts, one polished final. Starting at seventy-five dollars.

Layer two — branding. Series logos, style guides, visual identity systems that make every book in your series unmistakably part of the same family.

Layer three — series architecture. Chapter outlines, continuity plans, book descriptions, cross-book arc design. The blueprint before the build.

Layer four — character design. Photorealistic portraits with consistent style. Thirty unique characters across one series — every one recognizable, every one distinct.

Layer five — children's picture books. Thirty-two illustrated pages, consistent characters, print-ready PDF. Complete.

Stack them all together — that's the Full Pipeline. Covers, branding, planning, illustration — one partner, one vision, one delivery. No coordination headaches. No style mismatches.

We've done it three times. Three different genres. Three complete series. Twenty-two books. The proof isn't a promise — it's a portfolio.

Full Pipeline packages start at four hundred dollars. Everything your series needs — delivered in days. Metronagon dot com.
