POSTING SCHEDULE
-----------------

Week 1:
  Monday    — Video 01 (Elevator Pitch) on ALL platforms
  Thursday  — Video 02 (Portfolio Showcase) on ALL platforms

Week 2:
  Monday    — Video 03 (Series Branding) on ALL platforms
  Thursday  — Video 04 (Children's Book) on ALL platforms

Week 3:
  Monday    — Video 05 (Full Pipeline) on ALL platforms
  Thursday  — Video 06 (Origin Story) on ALL platforms

Best Posting Times:
  TikTok:   7-9 AM or 6-9 PM (user's timezone)
  YouTube:  12-3 PM or 5-8 PM
  Facebook: 9 AM-12 PM or 7-9 PM
  X:        8-10 AM or 12-1 PM (lunchtime engagement)

Post Order Matters:
  1. TikTok first (fastest algorithm response)
  2. YouTube Shorts second (slower but longer shelf life)
  3. Facebook Reels third (best for boosting)
  4. X last (text-first platform, video is supplementary)


WHY 2-3 DAYS BETWEEN VIDEOS (POSTING CADENCE LOGIC)
------------------------------------------------------

The Monday/Thursday rhythm (2-3 days apart) is not arbitrary. It is based on how
social media algorithms evaluate and distribute content. Here is the reasoning:

1. ALGORITHM EVALUATION WINDOW
   Every platform (TikTok, YouTube, Facebook) evaluates a new video's performance
   within the first 24-48 hours. The algorithm measures:
   - Completion rate (did people watch the full 60 seconds?)
   - Engagement rate (likes, comments, shares, saves relative to views)
   - Profile visits (did the video drive curiosity about your account?)
   If you post a second video before the first one finishes its evaluation window,
   the algorithm splits its distribution budget between both videos. Neither gets
   full attention. By waiting 2-3 days, each video gets its own clean evaluation
   window with the algorithm's full push behind it.

2. AUDIENCE FATIGUE PREVENTION
   Posting daily burns out your audience. Followers see too much of you and start
   scrolling past. The 2-3 day gap creates anticipation — "I wonder what they'll
   post next" — without the "they're posting again?" fatigue. This is especially
   important for a brand account vs. a personal creator account. Brands that post
   daily feel desperate. Brands that post consistently feel intentional.

3. ENGAGEMENT DECAY CURVE
   Comments and engagement on a video typically peak in the first 6-12 hours, then
   taper off over 48-72 hours. By posting your next video when engagement on the
   previous one has naturally declined, you create a fresh spike of activity on your
   profile. The algorithm sees consistent activity rather than one burst followed by
   silence. This creates a "staircase" pattern of engagement: spike, sustain, spike,
   sustain — which platforms reward with broader distribution.

4. CROSS-PLATFORM STAGGERING
   When you post on Monday, you have Monday afternoon/evening for TikTok engagement,
   Tuesday for YouTube pickup, Wednesday for Facebook group sharing. By Thursday,
   you've extracted maximum value from Video A across all platforms, and you're ready
   to launch Video B into a fresh cycle. If you posted A and B on the same day, you'd
   be splitting your own attention across two sets of comments on four platforms.

5. WHY MONDAY AND THURSDAY SPECIFICALLY
   - Monday: People return to routines after the weekend. Social media usage spikes
     during commutes and lunch breaks. Content posted Monday gets strong initial
     traction from the "back to work" browsing pattern.
   - Thursday: Engagement builds toward the weekend. People are winding down from work
     and spending more time on social media. Thursday content often carries momentum
     into Friday and Saturday viewing.
   - This avoids Tuesday/Wednesday (mid-week slump) and Friday-Sunday (weekend chaos
     where content gets buried under entertainment and personal posts).

6. THREE-WEEK ARC
   Six videos over three weeks creates a complete narrative arc:
   - Week 1: Introduction (who we are, what we've built)
   - Week 2: Proof (deep dives into specific capabilities)
   - Week 3: Trust (full offering + origin story)
   Anyone who follows you in Week 1 experiences a structured journey over 3 weeks
   that builds from curiosity to confidence to trust. This is storytelling applied
   to a posting schedule.

7. SCALING BEYOND 6 VIDEOS
   Once the initial 6-video Confidence Series is complete, the posting cadence shifts:
   - Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): 2 videos/week (Confidence Series — establishing the brand)
   - Phase 2 (Weeks 4-8): 3 videos/week (Mon/Wed/Fri — expanding the portfolio showcase)
   - Phase 3 (Weeks 9+): 5-7 videos/week (daily or near-daily — volume strategy)
   The cadence accelerates as your audience grows and the algorithm has more data
   about who engages with your content, enabling better targeting with each new video.


FUTURE CONTENT STRATEGY: SCALING TO 500+ VIDEOS
-------------------------------------------------

The initial 6 Confidence Scripts establish the Metronagon brand. To scale to 500+
videos, the content needs to diversify far beyond the current portfolio. The key
principle: every video needs its own unique visual assets (book covers, logos,
banners, character art) so the content never feels repetitive.

CONTENT CATEGORIES FOR 500+ VIDEOS:

Category 1: INDIVIDUAL COVER SPOTLIGHTS (150+ videos)
  Format: 15-30 second close-up showcase of a single book cover
  Structure: Dark screen > cover fades in > slow zoom > key details highlighted > CTA
  Narration: 2-3 sentences about the design choices, genre, or technique
  Visual assets needed: 150+ unique book covers across all genres
  Genres to cover:
    - Epic fantasy (dark, cinematic, warriors, magic)
    - Sci-fi (neon, futuristic, space, cyberpunk)
    - Romance (warm, soft lighting, couples, emotional)
    - Thriller/mystery (shadows, tension, urban, noir)
    - Horror (dark, atmospheric, unsettling, gothic)
    - Literary fiction (minimalist, elegant, typography-focused)
    - Historical fiction (period-accurate, rich textures, muted tones)
    - Self-help/business (clean, bold, authoritative, modern)
    - Memoir/biography (portrait-focused, personal, intimate)
    - Young adult (vibrant, dynamic, character-driven)
    - Children's (colorful, whimsical, warm, illustrated)
    - Poetry (artistic, abstract, emotional, ethereal)
    - Cookbook/lifestyle (bright, appetizing, lifestyle imagery)
    - True crime (gritty, documentary feel, evidence textures)
    - Spiritual/wellness (serene, light, natural elements)
  Why this works: Each cover is its own content piece. A fantasy reader sees a fantasy
  cover and thinks "I need that for MY book." Volume creates discoverability.

Category 2: GENRE COMPARISON REELS (50+ videos)
  Format: 30-60 second side-by-side or sequential comparison
  Structure: "Same author, two genres" or "Same technique, three results"
  Examples:
    - "Fantasy vs. Sci-fi: same pipeline, different worlds"
    - "Dark romance vs. sweet romance: how color palette changes everything"
    - "Thriller covers: what makes a reader pick it up?"
  Visual assets needed: Pairs/groups of covers in contrasting genres

Category 3: BEFORE/AFTER TRANSFORMATIONS (40+ videos)
  Format: 15-30 seconds showing a basic concept evolving into a polished cover
  Structure: Simple sketch/concept > intermediate > final polished cover
  Narration: "This is what happens when you think in design systems"
  Visual assets needed: Cover progressions (3 stages per video)

Category 4: SERIES SHOWCASE REELS (30+ videos)
  Format: 30-60 seconds showing a complete book series (3-12 covers)
  Structure: Covers revealed one by one, building the visual family
  Narration: Focus on consistency, branding, and the "shelf presence" effect
  Visual assets needed: 30+ complete mini-series (3-6 books each) across genres
  Series concepts:
    - Urban fantasy detective series (5 books)
    - Space opera trilogy
    - Cozy mystery series (8 books)
    - Dark academia series (4 books)
    - Paranormal romance series (6 books)
    - Business leadership series (5 books)
    - Historical mystery series (4 books)
    - Post-apocalyptic survival series (6 books)
    - Romantic comedy series (4 books)
    - Psychological thriller series (5 books)

Category 5: LOGO AND BRANDING SPOTLIGHTS (40+ videos)
  Format: 15-30 seconds showcasing a series logo or author brand
  Structure: Logo reveal with animation description, context about the brand
  Visual assets needed: 40+ unique series logos and author brand marks
  (TO BE CREATED LATER — logos and banners phase)

Category 6: CHILDREN'S BOOK PAGE REVEALS (50+ videos)
  Format: 15-30 seconds showing individual illustrated pages
  Structure: Page fade-in > slow zoom into details > character close-up
  Visual assets needed: 50+ unique children's book pages across different stories
  (TO BE CREATED LATER — children's illustration phase)

Category 7: LANDSCAPE AND BANNER ART (40+ videos)
  Format: 15-30 seconds showcasing panoramic art, box set covers, YouTube banners
  Visual assets needed: 40+ landscape/banner images
  (TO BE CREATED LATER — landscape and banner phase)

Category 8: EDUCATIONAL TIPS (50+ videos)
  Format: 30-60 seconds teaching a design concept
  Examples:
    - "Why your book cover colors matter more than you think"
    - "The 3-second rule: what readers see first on a cover"
    - "Typography on book covers: the mistakes everyone makes"
    - "How to make 12 books look like one series"
    - "Why your ebook cover needs to work at thumbnail size"
  Visual assets needed: Mix of existing covers + simple graphic examples

Category 9: TESTIMONIAL AND CASE STUDY VIDEOS (30+ videos)
  Format: 30-60 seconds featuring client work or portfolio deep-dives
  Structure: Client brief > process > result > reaction
  Visual assets needed: Client covers (as they come in) + portfolio examples

Category 10: TREND AND CULTURE VIDEOS (20+ videos)
  Format: 30-60 seconds commenting on design trends, publishing industry, AI art
  Examples:
    - "2026 book cover trends: what's working right now"
    - "AI art in publishing: why quality matters more than speed"
    - "The most common cover design mistake indie authors make"
  Visual assets needed: Minimal — mostly talking head with occasional examples

ASSET GENERATION PRIORITY ORDER:
  Phase 1 (NOW): Book covers — 10 example covers across diverse genres
  Phase 2 (NEXT): More book covers — expand to 50+ across all categories
  Phase 3: Series sets — groups of 3-6 matching covers per series
  Phase 4: Logos and brand marks for fictional series
  Phase 5: Landscape/panoramic art and banners
  Phase 6: Children's book illustrated pages
  Phase 7: Character portraits across genres

VOLUME POSTING STRATEGY (AFTER INITIAL 6 VIDEOS):
  Weeks 4-8:   3 videos/week (Mon/Wed/Fri) — Individual Cover Spotlights
  Weeks 9-12:  5 videos/week (weekdays) — Mix of covers + educational tips
  Weeks 13-20: 7 videos/week (daily) — Full category rotation
  Weeks 21+:   7-10 videos/week — Multiple daily posts on TikTok, daily on others

At 7 videos/week, reaching 500 videos takes approximately 70 weeks (16 months).
At 10 videos/week, it takes approximately 50 weeks (12 months).
The key is that EVERY video needs unique, high-quality visual assets — which is
why the image generation pipeline must be built and scaled BEFORE the scripts.


PLATFORM-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES
------------------------------

TIKTOK STRATEGY:
  - Post 2-3 times per week minimum
  - Use trending sounds ONLY if they complement the content (never override narration)
  - Engage with #BookTok, #AuthorTok, #WritingCommunity daily
  - Reply to every comment within the first hour of posting
  - Pin Video 01 (Elevator Pitch) and Video 06 (Origin Story) to profile
  - Use text overlays as scroll-stopping hooks on the first frame
  - Follow and engage with indie authors, book reviewers, and writing coaches
  - Stitch/Duet with popular BookTok creators when relevant
  - TikTok SEO: Use keywords naturally in descriptions (TikTok search is growing)

YOUTUBE STRATEGY:
  - Create a playlist: "Metronagon Confidence Series" with all 6 Shorts
  - YouTube Shorts have a longer shelf life than TikTok — they continue getting views for months
  - Optimize titles for search (include keywords like "book cover design," "indie author")
  - Descriptions should be detailed with links, service lists, and social media links
  - Consider creating longer companion videos (2-5 min):
    - Full 32-page children's book flip-through
    - Behind the scenes: how the AI pipeline works
    - Walkthrough of the Aztec series (all 12 covers)
  - Enable all engagement features (comments, likes)
  - Add end screens pointing to metronagon.com (when available for Shorts)

FACEBOOK STRATEGY:
  - Reels are the primary format — post all 6 videos as Reels
  - Supplement with static image carousels (4-6 images from the portfolio)
  - Share Reels to relevant Facebook groups:
    - Indie author groups
    - Self-publishing communities
    - Book cover design appreciation groups
    - Children's book author groups
    - Small business / entrepreneur groups
  - Facebook Ads/Boost strategy:
    - Video 04 (Children's Book) is the #1 boost priority (parents are on Facebook)
    - Video 01 (Elevator Pitch) is #2 (brand awareness)
    - Start with $5-10 per boost, scale what works
    - Target: Self-publishing, indie authors, book lovers, parents, teachers
    - Age: 25-55
    - Locations: United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia
  - Create a "Featured Video" section on the page with Video 06 (Origin Story)
  - Respond to every comment and message promptly

X (TWITTER) STRATEGY:
  - Post videos natively (upload directly, don't just share links)
  - Supplement each video with a text thread breaking down the key message:
    Example thread for Video 01:
      Tweet 1: "What does Metronagon do? Here it is in 60 seconds." [video]
      Tweet 2: "22 published books. 3 complete series. Every cover, portrait, and logo — built with the same pipeline we offer as a service."
      Tweet 3: "Photorealistic fantasy covers. Cinematic character portraits. Cohesive series branding. Pixar-quality children's book illustrations."
      Tweet 4: "The proof isn't a promise — it's a portfolio. metronagon.com"
  - Engage with #WritingCommunity, #IndieAuthor, #SelfPublishing, #BookCoverDesign daily
  - Retweet and reply to indie authors sharing their publishing journeys
  - Share individual portfolio images as standalone tweets between video posts
  - X is the best platform for direct engagement with potential clients
  - Use polls: "Which matters more for a book series: consistent covers or a great series logo?"


HASHTAG STRATEGY
-----------------

Core Hashtags (use on every post):
  #Metronagon #BookCoverDesign #IndieAuthor #SelfPublishing #AIArt

Rotating Hashtags (vary per post):
  #BookTok #AuthorTok #WritingCommunity #BookDesign #IndiePublishing
  #FantasyBooks #BookSeries #CoverDesign #BookMarketing #AuthorLife
  #CreativeBusiness #ChildrensBook #PictureBook #KidLit #SeriesBranding
  #SmallBusiness #BuildInPublic #Entrepreneur #StartupStory
  #PhotorealisticArt #CinematicArt #FantasyArt #CoverReveal

Platform-Specific Tags:
  TikTok: #BookTok #AuthorTok (these are communities, not just tags)
  YouTube: #Shorts (required for YouTube Shorts algorithm)
  Facebook: Fewer hashtags needed — 5-8 is optimal
  X: 2-3 hashtags max per tweet (X penalizes hashtag overuse)


ENGAGEMENT RULES
-----------------

1. Reply to every comment within the first hour of posting (boosts algorithm on all platforms)
2. Never ignore a question — even skeptical ones. Reply with confidence and warmth.
3. When someone asks about pricing: "Check out metronagon.com for all our packages!"
4. When someone asks "is this really AI?": "Yes — AI powered, human refined. That's our pipeline."
5. When someone is skeptical: "We understand. That's why every image on our site is real, published work."
6. Pin the best comment or your own comment that adds value
7. Follow back indie authors and writing community accounts
8. Like and comment on potential clients' content (genuine engagement, not spam)
9. Share/retweet client testimonials when available
10. Never argue with trolls — one professional response, then move on


CONTENT CALENDAR (BEYOND THE 6 VIDEOS)
----------------------------------------

After the initial 6 Confidence Scripts are posted, continue with:

Weekly Content Ideas:
  - Monday: Portfolio image post (single stunning image with caption)
  - Wednesday: Educational tip (series branding, cover design, publishing advice)
  - Friday: Video content (repurpose Confidence Scripts clips or create new content)

Monthly Content Ideas:
  - Client spotlight / testimonial video
  - Before/after series branding transformation
  - "How we made this" process reveal
  - New portfolio additions
  - Industry insights or trends

Evergreen Content (repost quarterly):
  - Video 01 (Elevator Pitch) — always relevant
  - Video 06 (Origin Story) — builds trust with new followers
  - Children's book page carousels — consistently high engagement


METRICS TO TRACK
-----------------

Weekly:
  - Views per video (across all platforms)
  - Engagement rate (likes + comments + shares / views)
  - Profile visits (indicates curiosity about the brand)
  - Website clicks from social (track in Google Analytics)

Monthly:
  - Follower growth per platform
  - Best performing video (to inform future content)
  - Best performing platform (to allocate more effort)
  - DMs and inquiries received
  - Conversions: social media visitor to website visitor to client inquiry

Key Performance Indicators:
  - TikTok: Views and completion rate (do people watch the whole 60 seconds?)
  - YouTube: Click-through rate and average view duration
  - Facebook: Shares and comments (Facebook rewards social interaction)
  - X: Retweets, replies, and profile clicks


COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
-------------------------

Metronagon is NOT:
  - A cheap cover design service
  - A template marketplace
  - A solo freelancer who might disappear
  - An AI tool that authors use themselves

Metronagon IS:
  - A premium, full-service creative studio
  - Backed by a real, published portfolio of 22 books
  - AI-powered but human-refined (the pipeline is the product)
  - The only service that thinks in SERIES, not single covers
  - Proven across 4 completely different genres

When a competitor comes up in conversation:
  - Never badmouth them
  - Simply say: "Our portfolio speaks for itself. Check metronagon.com."
  - The 22-book portfolio is the ultimate competitive advantage — no one else has built their proof this thoroughly
