PLATFORM-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES
------------------------------

TIKTOK STRATEGY:
  - Post 2-3 times per week minimum
  - Use trending sounds ONLY if they complement the content (never override narration)
  - Engage with #BookTok, #AuthorTok, #WritingCommunity daily
  - Reply to every comment within the first hour of posting
  - Pin Video 01 (Elevator Pitch) and Video 06 (Origin Story) to profile
  - Use text overlays as scroll-stopping hooks on the first frame
  - Follow and engage with indie authors, book reviewers, and writing coaches
  - Stitch/Duet with popular BookTok creators when relevant
  - TikTok SEO: Use keywords naturally in descriptions (TikTok search is growing)

YOUTUBE STRATEGY:
  - Create a playlist: "Metronagon Confidence Series" with all 6 Shorts
  - YouTube Shorts have a longer shelf life than TikTok — they continue getting views for months
  - Optimize titles for search (include keywords like "book cover design," "indie author")
  - Descriptions should be detailed with links, service lists, and social media links
  - Consider creating longer companion videos (2-5 min):
    - Full 32-page children's book flip-through
    - Behind the scenes: how the AI pipeline works
    - Walkthrough of the Aztec series (all 12 covers)
  - Enable all engagement features (comments, likes)
  - Add end screens pointing to metronagon.com (when available for Shorts)

FACEBOOK STRATEGY:
  - Reels are the primary format — post all 6 videos as Reels
  - Supplement with static image carousels (4-6 images from the portfolio)
  - Share Reels to relevant Facebook groups:
    - Indie author groups
    - Self-publishing communities
    - Book cover design appreciation groups
    - Children's book author groups
    - Small business / entrepreneur groups
  - Facebook Ads/Boost strategy:
    - Video 04 (Children's Book) is the #1 boost priority (parents are on Facebook)
    - Video 01 (Elevator Pitch) is #2 (brand awareness)
    - Start with $5-10 per boost, scale what works
    - Target: Self-publishing, indie authors, book lovers, parents, teachers
    - Age: 25-55
    - Locations: United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia
  - Create a "Featured Video" section on the page with Video 06 (Origin Story)
  - Respond to every comment and message promptly

X (TWITTER) STRATEGY:
  - Post videos natively (upload directly, don't just share links)
  - Supplement each video with a text thread breaking down the key message:
    Example thread for Video 01:
      Tweet 1: "What does Metronagon do? Here it is in 60 seconds." [video]
      Tweet 2: "22 published books. 3 complete series. Every cover, portrait, and logo — built with the same pipeline we offer as a service."
      Tweet 3: "Photorealistic fantasy covers. Cinematic character portraits. Cohesive series branding. Pixar-quality children's book illustrations."
      Tweet 4: "The proof isn't a promise — it's a portfolio. metronagon.com"
  - Engage with #WritingCommunity, #IndieAuthor, #SelfPublishing, #BookCoverDesign daily
  - Retweet and reply to indie authors sharing their publishing journeys
  - Share individual portfolio images as standalone tweets between video posts
  - X is the best platform for direct engagement with potential clients
  - Use polls: "Which matters more for a book series: consistent covers or a great series logo?"


HASHTAG STRATEGY
-----------------

Core Hashtags (use on every post):
  #Metronagon #BookCoverDesign #IndieAuthor #SelfPublishing #AIArt

Rotating Hashtags (vary per post):
  #BookTok #AuthorTok #WritingCommunity #BookDesign #IndiePublishing
  #FantasyBooks #BookSeries #CoverDesign #BookMarketing #AuthorLife
  #CreativeBusiness #ChildrensBook #PictureBook #KidLit #SeriesBranding
  #SmallBusiness #BuildInPublic #Entrepreneur #StartupStory
  #PhotorealisticArt #CinematicArt #FantasyArt #CoverReveal

Platform-Specific Tags:
  TikTok: #BookTok #AuthorTok (these are communities, not just tags)
  YouTube: #Shorts (required for YouTube Shorts algorithm)
  Facebook: Fewer hashtags needed — 5-8 is optimal
  X: 2-3 hashtags max per tweet (X penalizes hashtag overuse)


ENGAGEMENT RULES
-----------------

1. Reply to every comment within the first hour of posting (boosts algorithm on all platforms)
2. Never ignore a question — even skeptical ones. Reply with confidence and warmth.
3. When someone asks about pricing: "Check out metronagon.com for all our packages!"
4. When someone asks "is this really AI?": "Yes — AI powered, human refined. That's our pipeline."
5. When someone is skeptical: "We understand. That's why every image on our site is real, published work."
6. Pin the best comment or your own comment that adds value
7. Follow back indie authors and writing community accounts
8. Like and comment on potential clients' content (genuine engagement, not spam)
9. Share/retweet client testimonials when available
10. Never argue with trolls — one professional response, then move on


CONTENT CALENDAR (BEYOND THE 6 VIDEOS)
----------------------------------------

After the initial 6 Confidence Scripts are posted, continue with:

Weekly Content Ideas:
  - Monday: Portfolio image post (single stunning image with caption)
  - Wednesday: Educational tip (series branding, cover design, publishing advice)
  - Friday: Video content (repurpose Confidence Scripts clips or create new content)

Monthly Content Ideas:
  - Client spotlight / testimonial video
  - Before/after series branding transformation
  - "How we made this" process reveal
  - New portfolio additions
  - Industry insights or trends

Evergreen Content (repost quarterly):
  - Video 01 (Elevator Pitch) — always relevant
  - Video 06 (Origin Story) — builds trust with new followers
  - Children's book page carousels — consistently high engagement


METRICS TO TRACK
-----------------

Weekly:
  - Views per video (across all platforms)
  - Engagement rate (likes + comments + shares / views)
  - Profile visits (indicates curiosity about the brand)
  - Website clicks from social (track in Google Analytics)

Monthly:
  - Follower growth per platform
  - Best performing video (to inform future content)
  - Best performing platform (to allocate more effort)
  - DMs and inquiries received
  - Conversions: social media visitor to website visitor to client inquiry

Key Performance Indicators:
  - TikTok: Views and completion rate (do people watch the whole 60 seconds?)
  - YouTube: Click-through rate and average view duration
  - Facebook: Shares and comments (Facebook rewards social interaction)
  - X: Retweets, replies, and profile clicks


COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
-------------------------

Metronagon is NOT:
  - A cheap cover design service
  - A template marketplace
  - A solo freelancer who might disappear
  - An AI tool that authors use themselves

Metronagon IS:
  - A premium, full-service creative studio
  - Backed by a real, published portfolio of 22 books
  - AI-powered but human-refined (the pipeline is the product)
  - The only service that thinks in SERIES, not single covers
  - Proven across 4 completely different genres

When a competitor comes up in conversation:
  - Never badmouth them
  - Simply say: "Our portfolio speaks for itself. Check metronagon.com."
  - The 22-book portfolio is the ultimate competitive advantage — no one else has built their proof this thoroughly
