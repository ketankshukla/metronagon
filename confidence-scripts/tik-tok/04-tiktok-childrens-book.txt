STEP-BY-STEP UPLOAD PROCEDURE
------------------------------

1. Open TikTok app and tap the + button at the bottom center
2. Tap "Upload" (bottom right) and select the exported video file
3. The video should be 9:16 portrait, 60 seconds — TikTok will accept this natively
4. Trim if needed — ensure the video starts clean and ends on the logo
5. Tap "Next" to proceed to the editing screen

6. ADD SOUND: Set to "Original sound" — the video already has warm orchestral music baked in
   Do NOT add a TikTok sound over the top

7. ADD TEXT (optional on-screen text):
   - Add a text overlay at the very start (first 1-2 seconds): "AI made this children's book"
   - Font: Bold, white or gold
   - The disbelief hook drives curiosity taps

8. ADD COVER IMAGE:
   - Select a frame showing one of the vibrant children's book pages (around 0:06-0:10) as the thumbnail
   - The colorful illustration will pop in the TikTok feed and attract taps

9. Tap "Next" to go to the post screen

POST DETAILS

DESCRIPTION (copy-paste this):
Most people don't believe AI can create a children's picture book this good. 32 pages. Consistent characters on every single page. Same face, same proportions, page 1 through page 32. That's the hardest thing to achieve — and we've solved it.
