STEP-BY-STEP UPLOAD PROCEDURE
------------------------------

1. Open TikTok app and tap the + button at the bottom center
2. Tap "Upload" (bottom right) and select the exported video file
3. The video should be 9:16 portrait, 60 seconds — TikTok will accept this natively
4. Trim if needed — ensure the video starts clean and ends on the logo
5. Tap "Next" to proceed to the editing screen

6. ADD SOUND: Set to "Original sound" — the video already has epic orchestral music baked in
   Do NOT add a TikTok sound over the top

7. ADD TEXT (optional on-screen text):
   - Add a text overlay at the very start (first 1-2 seconds): "22 books of experience in 60 seconds"
   - Font: Bold, white or gold
   - This is a scroll-stopper hook

8. ADD COVER IMAGE:
   - Select a frame showing one of the stunning Aztec book covers (around 0:08-0:12) as the thumbnail
   - Choose the most visually dramatic cover for maximum tap-through

9. Tap "Next" to go to the post screen
