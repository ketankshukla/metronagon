ACCOUNT: Metronagon TikTok (@metronagon)

STEP-BY-STEP UPLOAD PROCEDURE
------------------------------

1. Open TikTok app and tap the + button at the bottom center
2. Tap "Upload" (bottom right) and select the exported video file
3. The video should be 9:16 portrait, 60 seconds — TikTok will accept this natively
4. Trim if needed — ensure the video starts clean and ends on the logo
5. Tap "Next" to proceed to the editing screen

6. ADD SOUND: Set to "Original sound" — the video already has orchestral music baked in
   Do NOT add a TikTok sound over the top

7. ADD TEXT (optional on-screen text):
   - Add a text overlay at the very start (first 1-2 seconds): "One cover is easy. A 12-book series? That's a system."
   - Font: Bold, white or gold
   - This is an educational hook — pattern interrupt

8. ADD COVER IMAGE:
   - Select a frame showing multiple Aztec covers in sequence (around 0:14-0:16) as the thumbnail
   - The visual impact of the consistent series is the selling point

9. Tap "Next" to go to the post screen

DESCRIPTION (copy-paste this):
Here's the difference between a book and a book series that sells. Any designer can make one cover. But what happens when you publish book 2? Book 3? That's where consistency becomes a system.
