TIKTOK UPLOAD GUIDE: VIDEO 06 — THE ORIGIN STORY
==================================================

VIDEO FILE: 06-video-script-origin-story (exported from HeyGen)
ACCOUNT: Metronagon TikTok (@metronagon)

STEP-BY-STEP UPLOAD PROCEDURE
------------------------------

1. Open TikTok app and tap the + button at the bottom center
2. Tap "Upload" (bottom right) and select the exported video file
3. The video should be 9:16 portrait, 60 seconds — TikTok will accept this natively
4. Trim if needed — ensure the video starts clean and ends on the logo
5. Tap "Next" to proceed to the editing screen

6. ADD SOUND: Set to "Original sound" — the video already has emotional piano/orchestral music baked in
   Do NOT add a TikTok sound over the top

7. ADD TEXT (optional on-screen text):
   - Add a text overlay at the very start (first 1-2 seconds): "We published 22 books. Then turned it into a business."
   - Font: Bold, white or gold
   - Story hooks perform extremely well on TikTok

8. ADD COVER IMAGE:
   - Select a frame showing the Metronagon logo reveal (around 0:42-0:44) as the thumbnail
   - Or use a frame of the first Aztec book cover for visual impact

9. Tap "Next" to go to the post screen

POST DETAILS
-------------

DESCRIPTION (copy-paste this):
We didn't start Metronagon to sell you something. We started it because we built something — and realized other authors needed it too. 22 books. 3 series. Every cover, every character, every visual element — built from scratch. The proof isn't a promise. It's a portfolio.
