ACCOUNT: Metronagon TikTok (@metronagon)

STEP-BY-STEP UPLOAD PROCEDURE
------------------------------

1. Open TikTok app and tap the + button at the bottom center
2. Tap "Upload" (bottom right) and select the exported video file
3. The video should be 9:16 portrait, 60 seconds — TikTok will accept this natively
4. Trim if needed — ensure the video starts clean and ends on the logo
5. Tap "Next" to proceed to the editing screen

6. ADD SOUND: Set to "Original sound" — the video already has percussive orchestral music baked in
   Do NOT add a TikTok sound over the top

7. ADD TEXT (optional on-screen text):
   - Add a text overlay at the very start (first 1-2 seconds): "5 layers. 1 pipeline. Everything your book needs."
   - Font: Bold, white or gold
   - The numbered list hook drives curiosity

8. ADD COVER IMAGE:
   - Select a frame showing the "THE FULL PIPELINE" gold text on black (around 0:36-0:38) as the thumbnail
   - Or use a frame of one of the striking book covers

9. Tap "Next" to go to the post screen
