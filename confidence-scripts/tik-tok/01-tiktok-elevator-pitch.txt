TIKTOK UPLOAD GUIDE: VIDEO 01 — THE ELEVATOR PITCH
====================================================

VIDEO FILE: 01-video-script-elevator-pitch (exported from HeyGen)
ACCOUNT: Metronagon TikTok (@metronagon)

STEP-BY-STEP UPLOAD PROCEDURE
------------------------------

1. Open TikTok app and tap the + button at the bottom center
2. Tap "Upload" (bottom right) and select the exported video file
3. The video should be 9:16 portrait, 60 seconds — TikTok will accept this natively
4. Trim if needed — ensure the video starts clean and ends on the logo
5. Tap "Next" to proceed to the editing screen

6. ADD SOUND: Set to "Original sound" — the video already has orchestral music baked in
   Do NOT add a TikTok sound over the top — it will clash with the narration

7. ADD TEXT (optional on-screen text):
   - Add a text overlay at the very start (first 1-2 seconds): "What does Metronagon do?"
   - Font: Bold, white or gold
   - This acts as a hook for scrollers

8. ADD COVER IMAGE:
   - Select a frame showing one of the book covers (around 0:08-0:10) as the cover thumbnail
   - This is what people see before they tap — make it visually striking

9. Tap "Next" to go to the post screen
