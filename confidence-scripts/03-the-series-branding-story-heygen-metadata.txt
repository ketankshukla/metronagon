PLATFORM-SPECIFIC NOTES

  - TikTok: Hashtags: #SeriesBranding #BookCoverDesign #IndieAuthor #BookTok #AuthorTips #SelfPublishing
  - YouTube Shorts: Title: "One cover is easy. A 12-book series? That's a system."
  - Hook: The first 3 seconds must hook — "Here's the difference" is a pattern-interrupt that stops the scroll
