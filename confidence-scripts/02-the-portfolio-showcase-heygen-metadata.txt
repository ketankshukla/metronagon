HeyGen Metadata — Script 02: The Portfolio Showcase

AVATAR SETTINGS

  - Avatar type: Professional male presenter (or custom Ketan avatar)
  - Appearance time: Only 0:00-0:04 and 0:52-0:60 — the middle section is voiceover only
  - Attire: Dark blazer or black crew neck — clean, minimal
  - Expression: Opening: inviting, "watch this" energy. Closing: confident, direct, "now you know" energy

VOICE SETTINGS

  - Voice style: Cinematic narrator — deeper register, slightly slower pace, weight behind every word
  - Pace: ~145 words per minute — slower than Script 01 because the images need room to breathe
  - Emphasis words: "twenty-two books," "photorealistic," "cinematic," "world-building," "Pixar-quality," "every single page," "we created it"
  - Pauses: 2-second pause at 0:04-0:07 (logo reveal), 1-second pause at 0:50-0:52 (logos landing)
  - Tone shift: Slightly more reverent/quiet during Reality series section (0:34-0:41), energized during children's book (0:41-0:50)

BACKGROUND

  - Talking head sections: Solid deep black (#0a0a0a)
  - Image showcase sections: Images fill the entire screen — no background visible
  - Transition style: Smooth dissolves (0.5s) between images, NOT hard cuts
