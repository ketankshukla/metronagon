- **Pace:** ~150 words per minute — slightly faster during the series reveal section to match the building visual energy
- **Emphasis words:** "twelve books," "same," "system," "three completely different," "I build series brands," "two-fifty"
- **Pauses:** Brief pause after "looks amateur" (0:12), dramatic pause at 0:48–0:52 (logos landing)
- **Tone shift:** Slightly critical/concerned during "looks amateur" (0:05–0:12), then pride and confidence from 0:12 onward

## Background

- **Talking head sections:** Solid deep black (#0a0a0a)
- **Image sections:** Images fill screen, dark background behind any gaps

## Platform-Specific Notes

- **TikTok:** Hashtags: #SeriesBranding #BookCoverDesign #IndieAuthor #BookTok #AuthorTips #SelfPublishing
- **YouTube Shorts:** Title: "One cover is easy. A 12-book series? That's a system."
- **Hook:** The first 3 seconds must hook — "Here's the difference" is a pattern-interrupt that stops the scroll
