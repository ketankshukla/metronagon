METRONAGON VIDEO SCRIPT 03: THE SERIES BRANDING STORY
=======================================================

VIDEO SPECIFICATIONS

  Duration: 60 seconds
  Aspect Ratio: 9:16 portrait (1080x1920)
  Resolution: 1080p minimum
  Frame Rate: 30fps
  Platform: TikTok / YouTube Shorts
  Purpose: Show how consistent branding transforms a book series from "random self-published books" to "professional publishing house product"
  Tone: Storytelling — "let us show you the difference" energy. Teacher meets creative director.

HEYGEN AVATAR SETTINGS

  Avatar type: Professional male presenter (or custom Ketan avatar)
  Appearance time: 0:00-0:05 (opening) and 0:52-0:60 (closing)
  Attire: Dark blazer, premium minimal look
  Expression: Opening: "We're about to teach you something" — knowing, direct. Closing: confident, authoritative close

HEYGEN VOICE SETTINGS

  Voice style: Creative director explaining a concept — authoritative but educational, not preachy
  Pace: ~150 words per minute — slightly faster during the series reveal section to match the building visual energy
  Emphasis words: "twelve books," "same," "system," "three completely different," "we build series brands," "two-fifty"
  Pauses: Brief pause after "looks amateur" (0:12), dramatic pause at 0:48-0:52 (logos landing)
  Tone shift: Slightly critical/concerned during "looks amateur" (0:05-0:12), then pride and confidence from 0:12 onward

HEYGEN BACKGROUND

  Talking head sections: Solid deep black (#0a0a0a)
  Image sections: Images fill screen, dark background behind any gaps
  Text overlay at 0:05: "ONE COVER vs. A SERIES" — gold (#d4af37) Cinzel or Playfair Display font, centered

HEYGEN CAPTIONS

  Enable: Yes
  Font color: Gold (#d4af37)
  Background: Semi-transparent black
  Position: Bottom third

HEYGEN MUSIC

  Category: "Epic" or "Cinematic Orchestral"
  Style: Confident orchestral progression — woodwinds and soft strings at 0:00, building to full brass and sweeping strings at 0:24 (the "all 12 books revealed" moment), sustaining energy through 0:48, warm resolution at 0:52
  Volume: 25% during talking head, 35% during image sequences
  Key moment: Musical "reveal" hit at 0:24 when all 12 Aztec covers are visible — a subtle brass punctuation that says "look at this"
  Reference: Thomas Bergersen "Creation of Earth" at low volume — that sense of something magnificent being built piece by piece
  Requirement: Must have a build — the track needs to grow with the visuals

PLATFORM NOTES

  TikTok: Hashtags: #SeriesBranding #BookCoverDesign #IndieAuthor #BookTok #AuthorTips #SelfPublishing
  YouTube Shorts: Title: "One cover is easy. A 12-book series? That's a system."
  Hook: The first 3 seconds must hook — "Here's the difference" is a pattern-interrupt that stops the scroll

SHOT-BY-SHOT PRODUCTION TIMELINE
=======================================================

Each shot specifies exactly what is on screen, the transition into and out of it,
and what the narrator is saying. "AVATAR" means the AI presenter is visible.
"IMAGE" means the avatar is hidden and a full-screen image is shown.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SHOT 01 | 0:00 - 0:05 | AVATAR — Opening Hook
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  On Screen: AI presenter, direct to camera, dark background (#0a0a0a)
  Motion: Static presenter, slight head tilt — "listen up" body language
  Transition In: Fade in from black over 0.3s
  Transition Out: 0.5s crossfade — avatar dissolves to black with text overlay
  Narration: "Here's the difference between a book and a book series that sells."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SHOT 02 | 0:05 - 0:08 | IMAGE — Text Overlay: The Problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  On Screen: Text graphic on solid black:
             "ONE COVER vs. A SERIES" in gold (#d4af37), large Cinzel font, centered
  Motion: Text fades in over 0.5s, holds, then fades out
  Transition In: 0.5s crossfade from avatar
  Transition Out: 0.5s dissolve to book cover
  Narration: "Any designer can make you one cover. But what happens when you publish book two? Book three?"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SHOT 03 | 0:08 - 0:12 | IMAGE — Single Cover (The Problem Illustrated)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  On Screen: aztec-book01-cover.jpg — centered, occupying 70% screen width
             Surrounded by black negative space to emphasize it being "alone"
  Motion: Slow zoom in (3% over 4s) — drawing the viewer into the single cover
  Transition In: 0.5s dissolve from text overlay
  Transition Out: Cover slides left as additional covers begin entering from right
  Narration: "If they don't match — if the fonts are different, the lighting is off, the style shifts — your series looks amateur."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SHOT 04 | 0:12 - 0:18 | IMAGE — Books 1-4 Building (The Solution Begins)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  On Screen: Four Aztec covers side by side, perfectly matched:
             aztec-book01-cover.jpg (already on screen, slides left)
             aztec-book02-cover.jpg (slides in from right at 0:13)
             aztec-book03-cover.jpg (slides in at 0:14.5)
             aztec-book04-cover.jpg (slides in at 0:16)
             Each cover ~22% screen width, arranged in a tight row
  Motion: Each cover slides in from right with 0.4s ease-in, staggered entry
  Transition In: Continuous from previous shot — book01 was already visible
  Transition Out: Row compresses slightly as books 5-8 join
  Narration: "This is what consistency looks like. Twelve books. Same color grading. Same typography system."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
SHOT 05 | 0:18 - 0:24 | IMAGE — Books 5-8 Join, Then All 12 Revealed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  On Screen: Building shelf effect:
             0:18-0:21 — Books 5-8 slide in, all 8 now visible in a compressed row
               aztec-book05-cover.jpg through aztec-book08-cover.jpg
             0:21-0:24 — Books 9-12 complete the shelf, all 12 visible
               aztec-book09-cover.jpg through aztec-book12-cover.jpg
             At 0:24 all 12 covers are visible, arranged in two rows of 6 (or one long scrolling row)
  Motion: Slow zoom out starting at 0:21 to reveal the full shelf (5% over 3s)
  Transition In: Covers continue sliding in from right
  Transition Out: 0.5s — hold at full reveal, then series logo fades in above
  MUSIC: Brass punctuation hit at 0:24 — the "reveal" moment
  Narration: "Same lighting direction. Same compositional language. A reader sees one — they recognize the rest instantly. That's not luck. That's a system."

PLAIN NARRATION SCRIPT
=======================================================
(Copy-paste this entire block into HeyGen's script field)

Here's the difference between a book and a book series that sells.

Any designer can make you one cover. But what happens when you publish book two? Book three? If they don't match — if the fonts are different, the lighting is off, the style shifts — your series looks amateur.

This is what consistency looks like. Twelve books. Same color grading. Same typography system. Same lighting direction. Same compositional language. A reader sees one — they recognize the rest instantly. That's not luck. That's a system.

A series logo that anchors the brand. A box set cover that sells all twelve as one premium product.

Different genre? Different mood? Same precision. Self-improvement series — authoritative, clean, powerful. Philosophical essays — contemplative, restrained, intellectual. Three completely different visual languages — all built with the same pipeline.

This is what we do. We don't design covers — we build series brands. Starting at two-fifty. Metronagon dot com.
