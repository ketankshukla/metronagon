METRONAGON VIDEO SCRIPT 03: THE SERIES BRANDING STORY
=======================================================

VIDEO SPECIFICATIONS

  Duration: 60 seconds
  Aspect Ratio: 9:16 portrait (1080x1920)
  Resolution: 1080p minimum
  Frame Rate: 30fps
  Platform: TikTok / YouTube Shorts
  Purpose: Show how consistent branding transforms a book series from "random self-published books" to "professional publishing house product"
  Tone: Storytelling — "let us show you the difference" energy. Teacher meets creative director.

HEYGEN AVATAR SETTINGS

  Avatar: Haley
  Appearance time: 0:00-0:05 (opening) and 0:52-0:60 (closing)
  Attire: Dark blazer, premium minimal look
  Expression: Opening: "We're about to teach you something" — knowing, direct. Closing: confident, authoritative close

HEYGEN VOICE SETTINGS

  Voice: Haley — creative director explaining a concept, authoritative but educational, not preachy
  Pace: ~150 words per minute — slightly faster during the series reveal section to match the building visual energy
  Emphasis words: "twelve books," "same," "system," "three completely different," "we build series brands"
  Pauses: Brief pause after "looks amateur" (0:12), dramatic pause at 0:48-0:52 (logos landing)
  Tone shift: Slightly critical/concerned during "looks amateur" (0:05-0:12), then pride and confidence from 0:12 onward

HEYGEN BACKGROUND

  Talking head sections: Solid deep black (#0a0a0a)
  Image sections: Images fill screen, dark background behind any gaps
  Text overlay at 0:05: "ONE COVER vs. A SERIES" — gold (#d4af37) Cinzel or Playfair Display font, centered

HEYGEN CAPTIONS

  Enable: Yes
  Font color: Gold (#d4af37)
  Background: Semi-transparent black
  Position: Bottom third

HEYGEN MUSIC

  Category: "Epic" or "Cinematic Orchestral"
  Style: Confident orchestral progression — woodwinds and soft strings at 0:00, building to full brass and sweeping strings at 0:24 (the "all 12 books revealed" moment), sustaining energy through 0:48, warm resolution at 0:52
  Volume: 25% during talking head, 35% during image sequences
  Key moment: Musical "reveal" hit at 0:24 when all 12 Aztec covers are visible — a subtle brass punctuation that says "look at this"
  Reference: Thomas Bergersen "Creation of Earth" at low volume — that sense of something magnificent being built piece by piece
  Requirement: Must have a build — the track needs to grow with the visuals

PLATFORM NOTES

  TikTok: Hashtags: #SeriesBranding #BookCoverDesign #IndieAuthor #BookTok #AuthorTips #SelfPublishing
  YouTube Shorts: Title: "One cover is easy. A 12-book series? That's a system."
  Hook: The first 3 seconds must hook — "Here's the difference" is a pattern-interrupt that stops the scroll

SHOT-BY-SHOT PRODUCTION TIMELINE
=======================================================

DISPLAY RULES FOR 9:16 PORTRAIT FORMAT:
  - Portrait images (book covers, character portraits): ONE per scene, full screen
  - Square images (children's book pages): ONE per scene, centered, dark bars top/bottom
  - Landscape images (panoramics, box sets): TWO stacked vertically, both fully visible, no cropping
  - No watermarks or logo overlays during avatar/narration scenes
  - No side-by-side images — every image gets the full frame

Each shot specifies exactly what is on screen, the transition into and out of it,
and what the narrator is saying. "AVATAR" means the AI presenter is visible.
"IMAGE" means the avatar is hidden and a full-screen image is shown.

PLAIN NARRATION SCRIPT
=======================================================
(Copy-paste this entire block into HeyGen's script field)

Here's the difference between a book and a book series that sells.

Any designer can make you one cover. But what happens when you publish book two? Book three? If they don't match — if the fonts are different, the lighting is off, the style shifts — your series looks amateur.

This is what consistency looks like. Twelve books. Same color grading. Same typography system. Same lighting direction. Same compositional language. A reader sees one — they recognize the rest instantly. That's not luck. That's a system.

A series logo that anchors the brand. A box set cover that sells all twelve as one premium product.

Different genre? Different mood? Same precision. Self-improvement series — authoritative, clean, powerful. Philosophical essays — contemplative, restrained, intellectual. Three completely different visual languages — all built with the same pipeline.

This is what we do. We don't design covers — we build series brands. Metronagon dot com.
