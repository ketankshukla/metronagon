# HeyGen Metadata — Script 06: The Origin Story

## Avatar Settings

- **Avatar type:** Professional male presenter (or custom Ketan avatar)
- **Appearance time:** 0:00–0:06 (opening), 0:44–0:55 (closing monologue) — more presenter time than other scripts
- **Attire:** Dark crew neck or blazer — premium but approachable
- **Expression:** Opening: reflective, genuine, "let me tell you something real." Closing: quiet power, absolute conviction, earned confidence — this is the most personal delivery of all six scripts

## Voice Settings

- **Voice style:** Personal and reflective in the opening — lower volume, slower pace, like sharing something meaningful. Builds to confident authority by the close.
- **Pace:** ~155 words per minute — starts slower (~140 wpm for 0:00–0:06), accelerates to normal pace through the middle, slows slightly for the closing conviction
- **Emphasis words:** "I built something," "from scratch," "not outsourced, not templated — built," "same pipeline, same standard," "already done," "every cover is real," "the measure of excellence"
- **Pauses:** 1-second pause after "needed it too" (0:06), brief pause after "Built." (0:25), 1-second pause after "This is a service." (0:44), final pause before tagline (0:55)
- **Tone arc:** Reflective → building → proud → commanding. This script should feel like watching someone realize the magnitude of what they've accomplished.

## Background

- **Talking head sections:** Solid deep black (#0a0a0a) — clean, intimate, nothing to distract from the personal delivery
- **Image sections:** Portfolio images fill screen during middle section
- **Transition style:** Slow dissolves throughout — this script is not fast-cut, it's deliberate and measured

## Music

- **Category:** "Emotional" / "Inspirational" — NOT "Epic" — this script is personal, not bombastic
- **Volume:** 20% opening, 30% middle, 35% peak at logo reveal, 25% closing
- **Critical requirement:** The track must have an emotional arc — intimate start, steady build, warm peak, gentle resolution
- **Piano is ideal for the opening** — if HeyGen allows layering, start with piano only, add strings at 0:12

## Captions

- **Enable:** Yes
- **Font color:** Gold (#d4af37)
- **Background:** Semi-transparent black
- **Position:** Bottom third
- **Style:** Clean sans-serif, moderate size — not too large, this script earns attention through delivery, not bold text

## Export Settings

- **Primary:** 9:16 (1080x1920) for TikTok / Shorts / Reels
- **Secondary:** 16:9 (1920x1080) for YouTube / Facebook
- **Resolution:** 1080p

## Platform-Specific Notes

- **All platforms:** This is the MOST VERSATILE script — works everywhere because it tells a genuine story
- **TikTok:** Hashtags: #SmallBusiness #BuildInPublic #IndieAuthor #BookTok #Entrepreneur #CreativeBusiness #AIArt
- **YouTube Shorts:** Title: "I published 22 books. Then I turned the process into a business."
- **Facebook:** Best for brand awareness — the story format generates shares and comments
- **Instagram Reels:** Pin to profile — this is the "about us" video every potential client should see first
- **LinkedIn:** This script also works on LinkedIn for professional credibility — the "built it myself first" angle resonates with entrepreneurs

## Special Notes

This is the script to lead with. If you only make one video, make this one. It establishes:
1. **Credibility** — 22 books, 3 series, real published work
2. **Origin** — built for himself first, now offering as a service
3. **Range** — fantasy, self-help, philosophy, children's — different genres, same quality
4. **Trust** — "the proof isn't a promise, it's a portfolio"
5. **Confidence** — earned, not performed
