At Metronagon Media, we create professional book covers, series branding, and complete publishing packages for authors — powered by AI, refined by craft.

We built this business the only way we trust — by doing it ourselves first. Twenty-two published books. Three complete series. Every single cover, every character portrait, every logo — created with the same pipeline we now offer as a service.

We're talking photorealistic fantasy covers. Cinematic character portraits. Cohesive series branding that makes twelve books look like they belong on the same shelf. And Pixar-quality children's book illustrations — thirty-two pages, consistent characters, assembled and print-ready.

What makes us different? We don't just design a cover. We think in series. Logos, box sets, panoramic art, YouTube thumbnails, style guides — everything an author needs to look like a professional publishing house, not a solo operation.

Covers start at seventy-five dollars. Full series pipelines go up to fifteen hundred. Everything is delivered in days, not weeks. The proof is the portfolio — twenty-two books, three series, all live, all real.

Metronagon dot com. The measure of excellence.
