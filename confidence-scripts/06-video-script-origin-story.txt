METRONAGON VIDEO SCRIPT 06: THE ORIGIN STORY
===============================================

VIDEO SPECIFICATIONS

  Duration: 60 seconds
  Aspect Ratio: 9:16 portrait (1080x1920)
  Resolution: 1080p minimum
  Frame Rate: 30fps
  Platform: All platforms — this is the most versatile script
  Purpose: The credibility pitch — "We didn't just start a business, we built the proof first." The trust-builder, the story that turns a stranger into a believer.
  Tone: Personal, reflective, building to powerful conviction — like the opening monologue of a prestige documentary

HEYGEN AVATAR SETTINGS

  Avatar type: Professional male presenter (or custom Ketan avatar)
  Appearance time: 0:00-0:06 (opening), 0:44-0:55 (closing monologue) — more presenter time than other scripts
  Attire: Dark crew neck or blazer — premium but approachable
  Expression: Opening: reflective, genuine, "let us tell you something real." Closing: quiet power, absolute conviction, earned confidence

HEYGEN VOICE SETTINGS

  Voice style: Personal and reflective in the opening — lower volume, slower pace, like sharing something meaningful. Builds to confident authority by the close.
  Pace: Starts slower (~140 wpm for 0:00-0:06), accelerates to ~155 wpm through the middle, slows slightly for closing conviction
  Emphasis words: "we built something," "from scratch," "not outsourced, not templated — built," "same pipeline, same standard," "already done," "every cover is real," "the measure of excellence"
  Pauses: 1-second pause after "needed it too" (0:06), brief pause after "Built." (0:25), 1-second pause after "This is a service." (0:44), final pause before tagline (0:55)
  Tone arc: Reflective -> building -> proud -> commanding. Should feel like watching someone realize the magnitude of what they've accomplished.

HEYGEN BACKGROUND

  Talking head sections: Solid deep black (#0a0a0a) — clean, intimate, nothing to distract from the personal delivery
  Image sections: Portfolio images fill screen during middle section
  Transition style: Slow dissolves throughout — this script is not fast-cut, it's deliberate and measured

HEYGEN CAPTIONS

  Enable: Yes
  Font color: Gold (#d4af37)
  Background: Semi-transparent black
  Position: Bottom third
  Style: Clean sans-serif, moderate size — not too large, this script earns attention through delivery, not bold text

HEYGEN MUSIC

  Category: "Emotional" / "Inspirational" — NOT "Epic" — this script is personal, not bombastic
  Style: Intimate to epic — starts with a single piano playing a reflective melody (0:00-0:12), strings enter gently at 0:12, builds steadily through 0:22-0:35, reaches full orchestral warmth at 0:41 (logo reveal), holds that emotional power through the close
  Volume: 20% during the intimate opening (0:00-0:12), 30% during the building middle, 35% at the emotional peak (0:41-0:55), back to 25% for the final seconds
  Feel: The feeling of watching a company's life work unfold — pride, weight, earned confidence. NOT triumphant or boastful. Earned.
  Reference: Max Richter "On the Nature of Daylight" meets Hans Zimmer "Time" — start intimate and reflective, build to something vast and moving
  Key moment: The emotional swell at 0:41 when the Metronagon logo appears should feel like the moment in a documentary where everything clicks into place
  Piano ideal for opening — if HeyGen allows layering, start with piano only, add strings at 0:12

PLATFORM NOTES

  All platforms: This is the MOST VERSATILE script — works everywhere because it tells a genuine story
  TikTok: Hashtags: #SmallBusiness #BuildInPublic #IndieAuthor #BookTok #Entrepreneur #CreativeBusiness #AIArt
  YouTube Shorts: Title: "We published 22 books. Then we turned the process into a business."
  Facebook: Best for brand awareness — the story format generates shares and comments
  Instagram Reels: Pin to profile — this is the "about us" video every potential client should see first
  LinkedIn: This script also works on LinkedIn for professional credibility

SPECIAL NOTES

  This is the script to lead with. If you only make one video, make this one. It establishes:
  1. Credibility — 22 books, 3 series, real published work
  2. Origin — built for ourselves first, now offering as a service
  3. Range — fantasy, self-help, philosophy, children's — different genres, same quality
  4. Trust — "the proof isn't a promise, it's a portfolio"
  5. Confidence — earned, not performed

SHOT-BY-SHOT PRODUCTION TIMELINE
===============================================

DISPLAY RULES FOR 9:16 PORTRAIT FORMAT:
  - Portrait images (book covers, character portraits): ONE per scene, full screen
  - Square images (children's book pages): ONE per scene, centered, dark bars top/bottom
  - Landscape images (panoramics, box sets, thumbnails): TWO stacked vertically, both fully visible, no cropping
  - No watermarks or logo overlays during avatar/narration scenes
  - No side-by-side images — every image gets the full frame

Each shot specifies exactly what is on screen, the transition into and out of it,
and what the narrator is saying. "AVATAR" means the AI presenter is visible.
"IMAGE" means the avatar is hidden and a full-screen image is shown.

===============================================
PLAIN NARRATION SCRIPT
===============================================
(Copy-paste this entire block into HeyGen's script field)

We didn't start Metronagon to sell you something. We started it because we built something — and realized other authors needed it too.

It began with one book. Then two. Then twelve. A complete fantasy series — every cover, every character, every visual element designed and generated through a pipeline we built from scratch.

Thirty character portraits, each one distinct, each one consistent with the world. A series logo. Box set art. Panoramic covers. Not outsourced. Not templated. Built.

Then we did it again. A self-improvement series. A philosophical essay series. A children's picture book. Four completely different visual languages — same pipeline, same standard, same obsessive attention to detail.

Twenty-two books. Three complete series. Four live portfolio websites. Thumbnails, style guides, brand systems. And then we looked at what we'd built and thought — this isn't just our workflow. This is a service.

That's Metronagon. Not a promise of what we could do — a portfolio of what we've already done. Every cover on our site is real. Every series is published. Every image was created with the exact same process we use for your project.

Metronagon dot com. The measure of excellence.
