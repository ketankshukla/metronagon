METRONAGON VIDEO SCRIPT 02: THE PORTFOLIO SHOWCASE
====================================================

VIDEO SPECIFICATIONS

  Duration: 60 seconds
  Aspect Ratio: 9:16 portrait (1080x1920)
  Resolution: 1080p minimum
  Frame Rate: 30fps
  Platform: TikTok / YouTube Shorts / Instagram Reels
  Purpose: A visually-driven reel that lets the work speak — rapid-fire portfolio showcase designed to stop the scroll
  Tone: Cinematic, awe-inspiring — like a movie trailer for a design studio

HEYGEN AVATAR SETTINGS

  Avatar: Haley
  Appearance time: Only 0:00-0:04 and 0:52-0:60 — the middle 48 seconds are voiceover only
  Attire: Dark blazer or black crew neck — clean, minimal
  Expression: Opening: inviting, "watch this" energy. Closing: confident, direct, "now you know" energy

HEYGEN VOICE SETTINGS

  Voice: Haley — cinematic narrator, deeper register, slightly slower pace, weight behind every word
  Pace: ~145 words per minute — slower than Script 01 because the images need room to breathe
  Emphasis words: "twenty-two books," "photorealistic," "cinematic," "world-building," "Pixar-quality," "every single page," "we created it"
  Pauses: 2-second pause at 0:04-0:07 (logo reveal), 1-second pause at 0:50-0:52 (logos landing)
  Tone shift: Slightly more reverent/quiet during Reality series section (0:34-0:41), energized during children's book (0:41-0:50)

HEYGEN BACKGROUND

  Talking head sections: Solid deep black (#0a0a0a)
  Image showcase sections: Images fill the entire screen — no background visible
  Transition style: Smooth dissolves (0.5s) between images, NOT hard cuts

HEYGEN CAPTIONS

  Enable: Yes
  Font color: Gold (#d4af37)
  Background: Semi-transparent black
  Position: Bottom center, slightly higher than default to avoid platform UI overlap
  Size: Large — this is a visual-first video, captions should be bold

HEYGEN MUSIC

  Category: "Epic" or "Cinematic" category, or upload a custom royalty-free orchestral track
  Style: Epic orchestral build — starts with a single piano note at 0:00, strings enter at 0:07, full orchestral swell from 0:18 to 0:48, then resolves to warm strings at 0:52
  Volume: 30% during talking head (0:00-0:04, 0:52-0:56), 35-40% during image showcase (0:04-0:52) since there's no competing face-to-face visual
  Key moments: Percussion hit at 0:07 (first cover reveal), brass swell at 0:18 (character portraits), emotional peak at 0:41 (children's book), resolution at 0:52
  Reference: Audiomachine "Guardians at the Gate" at low volume — that building, sweeping orchestral energy
  Requirement: The track must BUILD — start quiet, crescendo through the middle, resolve at the end

SHOT-BY-SHOT PRODUCTION TIMELINE
====================================================

DISPLAY RULES FOR 9:16 PORTRAIT FORMAT:
  - Portrait images (book covers, character portraits): ONE per scene, full screen
  - Square images (children's book pages): ONE per scene, centered, dark bars top/bottom
  - Landscape images (panoramics, box sets): TWO stacked vertically, both fully visible, no cropping
  - No watermarks or logo overlays during avatar/narration scenes
  - No side-by-side images — every image gets the full frame

Each shot specifies exactly what is on screen, the transition into and out of it,
and what the narrator is saying. "AVATAR" means the AI presenter is visible.
"IMAGE" means the avatar is hidden and a full-screen image is shown.

(Copy-paste this entire block into HeyGen's script field)

Let us show you what twenty-two books of experience looks like.

Twelve-book fantasy series. Every cover photorealistic. Every composition cinematic. Every single one designed to stop a reader mid-scroll and make them click.

Thirty character portraits. Each one unique. Each one consistent with the world they inhabit. This is not clip art. This is world-building.

Self-improvement series with authoritative branding. Five books that look like they came from a publishing house with a fifty-person design team.

Philosophical essays with quiet, contemplative covers. Different genre. Different mood. Same level of craft.

And Pixar-quality children's book illustrations. Thirty-two pages. Consistent characters on every single page. Assembled, formatted, print-ready.

Everything you just saw — we created it. And now we create it for you. Metronagon dot com.
