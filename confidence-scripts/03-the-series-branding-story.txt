VISUAL DIRECTION

This script uses a BEFORE/AFTER transformation concept. The first half emphasizes the problem (inconsistent books look amateur), and the second half reveals the solution through real portfolio work. The visual rhythm accelerates as the narration builds confidence. Think of it as a mini case study — the kind of content that makes authors think "I need this."

MUSIC DIRECTION

  - Track style: Confident orchestral progression — woodwinds and soft strings at 0:00, building to full brass and sweeping strings at 0:24 (the "all 12 books revealed" moment), sustaining energy through 0:48, warm resolution at 0:52
  - Volume: 25% during talking head, 35% during image sequences
  - Key moment: Musical "reveal" hit at 0:24 when all 12 Aztec covers are visible — a subtle brass punctuation that says "look at this"
  - Reference: Thomas Bergersen "Creation of Earth" at low volume — that sense of something magnificent being built piece by piece

NARRATION SCRIPT (with timing)

[0:00-0:05] (presenter to camera)
"Here's the difference between a book and a book series that sells."

[0:05-0:12] (single cover, then expanding)
"Any designer can make you one cover. But what happens when you publish book two? Book three? If they don't match — if the fonts are different, the lighting is off, the style shifts — your series looks amateur."

[0:12-0:28] (Aztec covers building into full shelf)
"This is what consistency looks like. Twelve books. Same color grading. Same typography system. Same lighting direction. Same compositional language. A reader sees one — they recognize the rest instantly. That's not luck. That's a system."

[0:28-0:34] (logo + box set)
"A series logo that anchors the brand. A box set cover that sells all twelve as one premium product."

[0:34-0:48] (Repetition + Reality series)
"Different genre? Different mood? Same precision. Self-improvement series — authoritative, clean, powerful. Philosophical essays — contemplative, restrained, intellectual. Three completely different visual languages — all built with the same pipeline."

[0:48-0:52] (three logos side by side)
(Beat — let the logos land)

[0:52-0:60] (presenter returns)
"This is what we do. We don't design covers — we build series brands. Starting at two-fifty. Metronagon dot com."
