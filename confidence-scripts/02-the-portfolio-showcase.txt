Script 02: The Portfolio Showcase

Duration: 60 seconds
Purpose: A visually-driven reel that lets the work speak — rapid-fire portfolio showcase designed to stop the scroll

Tone: Cinematic, awe-inspiring — like a movie trailer for a design studio

VISUAL DIRECTION

This is an IMAGE-FORWARD script. The presenter appears only at the opening and closing. The middle 45 seconds are a cinematic cascade of portfolio images with voiceover narration. Each image should have subtle motion — slow zoom, gentle pan, or parallax effect — to create that premium Ken Burns documentary feel. Transitions between images should be smooth dissolves or elegant slide-ins, NOT hard cuts.

MUSIC DIRECTION

  - Track style: Epic orchestral build — starts with a single piano note at 0:00, strings enter at 0:07, full orchestral swell from 0:18 to 0:48, then resolves to warm strings at 0:52
  - Volume: 30% during talking head sections (0:00-0:04, 0:52-0:56), 40% during image showcase (0:04-0:52) since there's no competing face-to-face visual
  - Key moments: Percussion hit at 0:07 (first cover reveal), brass swell at 0:18 (character portraits), emotional peak at 0:41 (children's book), resolution at 0:52
  - Reference: Audiomachine "Guardians at the Gate" at low volume — that building, sweeping orchestral energy

NARRATION SCRIPT (with timing)

[0:00-0:04] (presenter to camera)
"Let us show you what twenty-two books of experience looks like."

[0:04-0:07] (logo reveal)
(Beat — let the logo breathe)

[0:07-0:18] (Aztec covers cascading)
"Twelve-book fantasy series. Every cover photorealistic. Every composition cinematic. Every single one designed to stop a reader mid-scroll and make them click."

[0:18-0:25] (character portraits)
"Thirty character portraits. Each one unique. Each one consistent with the world they inhabit. This is not clip art. This is world-building."

[0:25-0:34] (panoramics + Repetition series)
"Self-improvement series with authoritative branding. Five books that look like they came from a publishing house with a fifty-person design team."

[0:34-0:41] (Reality series)
"Philosophical essays with quiet, contemplative covers. Different genre. Different mood. Same level of craft."

[0:41-0:50] (children's book pages)
"And Pixar-quality children's book illustrations. Thirty-two pages. Consistent characters on every single page. Assembled, formatted, print-ready."

[0:50-0:52] (series logos)
(Beat — let the logos land)

[0:52-0:60] (presenter returns)
"Everything you just saw — we created it. And now we create it for you. Metronagon dot com."
