HeyGen Metadata — Script 06: The Origin Story

AVATAR SETTINGS

  - Avatar type: Professional male presenter (or custom Ketan avatar)
  - Appearance time: 0:00-0:06 (opening), 0:44-0:55 (closing monologue) — more presenter time than other scripts
  - Attire: Dark crew neck or blazer — premium but approachable
  - Expression: Opening: reflective, genuine, "let us tell you something real." Closing: quiet power, absolute conviction, earned confidence — this is the most personal delivery of all six scripts

VOICE SETTINGS

  - Voice style: Personal and reflective in the opening — lower volume, slower pace, like sharing something meaningful. Builds to confident authority by the close.
  - Pace: ~155 words per minute — starts slower (~140 wpm for 0:00-0:06), accelerates to normal pace through the middle, slows slightly for the closing conviction
  - Emphasis words: "we built something," "from scratch," "not outsourced, not templated — built," "same pipeline, same standard," "already done," "every cover is real," "the measure of excellence"
  - Pauses: 1-second pause after "needed it too" (0:06), brief pause after "Built." (0:25), 1-second pause after "This is a service." (0:44), final pause before tagline (0:55)
  - Tone arc: Reflective -> building -> proud -> commanding. This script should feel like watching someone realize the magnitude of what they've accomplished.

BACKGROUND

  - Talking head sections: Solid deep black (#0a0a0a) — clean, intimate, nothing to distract from the personal delivery
  - Image sections: Portfolio images fill screen during middle section
  - Transition style: Slow dissolves throughout — this script is not fast-cut, it's deliberate and measured

MUSIC

  - Category: "Emotional" / "Inspirational" — NOT "Epic" — this script is personal, not bombastic
  - Volume: 20% opening, 30% middle, 35% peak at logo reveal, 25% closing
  - Critical requirement: The track must have an emotional arc — intimate start, steady build, warm peak, gentle resolution
  - Piano is ideal for the opening — if HeyGen allows layering, start with piano only, add strings at 0:12

SPECIAL NOTES

This is the script to lead with. If you only make one video, make this one. It establishes:
  1. Credibility — 22 books, 3 series, real published work
  2. Origin — built for ourselves first, now offering as a service
  3. Range — fantasy, self-help, philosophy, children's — different genres, same quality
  4. Trust — "the proof isn't a promise, it's a portfolio"
  5. Confidence — earned, not performed
