OPTION A — CONCISE & PROFESSIONAL
======================================================================

Subject: Re: Title Creation Limit Exception Request

Dear Jayasudha and the KDP Team,

Thank you for your prompt response. I am happy to provide the requested
details.

REASON FOR EXCEPTION
I am an independent author-publisher operating under the name Ketan Shukla.
I have already written and completed three full book series — 22 books in
total — and I am in the process of publishing them all to KDP. These are
not rushed or low-quality titles; they are fully written, edited, and
formatted manuscripts that have been in development for an extended period.
The 10-title-per-week limit creates an artificial delay in bringing
completed, ready-to-publish work to market.

NUMBER OF BOOKS AND CADENCE
I have 22 completed books across three series:
- Aztec Samurai Adventures: 12 books (epic fantasy fiction)
- Reality Without Belief: 5 books (philosophical non-fiction)
- Repetition: Mother of Mastery: 5 books (self-improvement non-fiction)

I am requesting the ability to publish all 22 titles over a 2–3 week
period to begin with. Beyond that, I am actively developing additional
series and titles as part of an ongoing effort to build a substantial
publishing catalogue. My goal is to grow as an indie publisher with a
broad body of work, which requires the ability to publish at a pace
that reflects the volume of work I produce.

QUALITY CONTROLS
Each book has undergone the following quality process:
- Full manuscript written and self-edited by the author
- Cover design produced to Amazon KDP specifications (1600x2400, 300 DPI)
- Interior formatted to KDP Print and Kindle standards
- Metadata (title, description, keywords, categories) individually
  researched and written for each book
- Each book is a distinct, original work — not duplicated or AI-spun content

TYPE OF CONTENT
All 22 books are original, long-form works of fiction and non-fiction:
- Epic fantasy fiction (Aztec Samurai Adventures series, 12 books)
- Philosophical essay collections (Reality Without Belief series, 5 books)
- Self-improvement and habit formation (Repetition: Mother of Mastery, 5 books)

All content is entirely original, written by me, and complies fully with
KDP's content guidelines.

I appreciate your consideration and am happy to provide manuscript samples,
cover files, or any additional documentation you require.

Kind regards,
Ketan Shukla
Independent Author-Publisher


======================================================================
OPTION B — DETAILED WITH BUSINESS CONTEXT
======================================================================

Subject: Re: Title Creation Limit Exception Request

Dear Jayasudha and the KDP Team,

Thank you for the opportunity to provide further detail. I understand the
importance of the title creation limit in maintaining platform quality, and
I want to demonstrate clearly that my situation warrants an exception.

1. REASON FOR EXCEPTION

I am an independent author-publisher who has spent the past several years
writing, editing, designing, and producing three complete book series from
the ground up. All 22 books are fully completed — manuscripts written,
covers professionally designed, interiors formatted, and metadata prepared.

My business, Metronagon Media, was built around the creation of this
portfolio. The books represent years of creative and production work, and
I am now at the stage of bringing them all to market simultaneously as a
coordinated launch. The 10-title-per-week limit, while reasonable for
ongoing publishing operations, creates a significant delay for a one-time
launch of a completed back catalogue.

This is not a case of bulk-generating content. Each book is a distinct,
substantial work of fiction or non-fiction, individually written and
produced to professional standards.

2. NUMBER OF BOOKS AND SUBMISSION CADENCE

Total books: 22, across three series.

Series breakdown:
- Aztec Samurai Adventures (epic fantasy fiction): 12 books
  Books I through XII, each a full-length novel in a continuous saga
- Reality Without Belief (philosophical non-fiction): 5 books
  A five-part essay series exploring perception, belief, and reality
- Repetition: Mother of Mastery (self-improvement non-fiction): 5 books
  A five-part series on habit formation, mastery, and cognitive performance

Requested cadence: I would like to begin by submitting my 22 completed
titles over the next 2–3 weeks. Beyond that, I am actively developing
additional series and titles as part of an ongoing effort to build a
substantial, professional publishing catalogue. My goal is to establish
myself as a credible, experienced indie publisher with a broad and growing
body of work — which requires the ability to publish new titles at a pace
that reflects the volume of work I produce.

3. QUALITY CONTROLS

Every title in my catalogue has been produced under the following controls:

Content quality:
- Each book is an original, long-form work written entirely by me
- Fiction titles average 60,000–80,000 words per book
- Non-fiction titles are structured, chapter-based works with consistent
  pedagogical progression across each series
- No AI-generated or spun content; all writing is original

Production quality:
- Cover design: professionally produced at 1600x2400px, 300 DPI, in
  Amazon KDP-compliant formats
- Interior formatting: formatted to KDP Print and Kindle specifications,
  including proper margins, bleed, and font embedding
- Metadata: title, subtitle, description, keywords, and BISAC categories
  individually researched and written for each book
- Series branding: each series has a consistent visual identity (logo,
  colour palette, typography) applied across all covers

I have also built dedicated portfolio websites for each series, which
demonstrate the depth and quality of the work:
- aztec.ketanshukla.com (Aztec Samurai Adventures)
- ketanshukla.com (author portfolio — all three series)

4. TYPE OF CONTENT

All 22 books are original, full-length works in the following categories:

Fiction:
- Epic fantasy (Aztec Samurai Adventures, 12 books)
  A complete 12-book saga following a prophesied warrior across three acts.
  Each book is a standalone entry in a continuous narrative arc.

Non-fiction:
- Philosophical essays (Reality Without Belief, 5 books)
  A five-part exploration of perception, consciousness, and the nature of
  belief, written for a general intellectual audience.
- Self-improvement (Repetition: Mother of Mastery, 5 books)
  A five-part series on habit formation, deliberate practice, and mastery,
  drawing on cognitive science and behavioural psychology.

All content is entirely original, complies fully with KDP's content
guidelines, and contains no duplicate, plagiarised, or AI-generated material.

I am happy to provide manuscript samples, cover files, ISBNs, or any
additional documentation that would assist your review. I appreciate your
time and consideration.

Kind regards,
Ketan Shukla

RECOMMENDATION
======================================================================

Use OPTION B if you want to make the strongest possible case — it gives
Amazon the most detail and demonstrates you are a serious, organised
publisher. OPTION A is a solid middle ground. OPTION C is best if you
want to keep it brief and trust the facts to speak for themselves.

In all cases, consider attaching or linking to:
- Your author portfolio site (ketanshukla.com)
- One sample cover image from each series
- This will make the quality of your work immediately visible.
