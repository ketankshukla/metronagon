# Final Pricing — Professional Tier

## Why the Previous Prices Were Wrong

The previous pricing document (`REEDSY-COMPETITIVE-PRICES.md`) positioned you as a **beginner** charging **beginner rates** — $150 for a single cover, $400 for a 3-book branding package, $950 for a 10-book series. The reasoning was: zero client reviews = beginner prices.

**That logic was flawed.** Here's why:

### The Work is Not Beginner-Level

Each book cover starts with a **2,500–3,000 word creative brief** — a detailed, genre-specific document that specifies:

- Exact character descriptions (face, hair, build, expression, clothing, armor, weapons)
- Background composition (setting, architecture, environmental details)
- Atmospheric effects (lighting, particles, color grading, volumetric effects)
- Mood and emotional tone (specific adjectives, references, cinematic direction)
- Typography specifications (font family, size, weight, color, placement, effects)
- Technical requirements (resolution, style constraints, what to avoid)

This is not prompt engineering. This is **professional creative direction** — the same kind of work an art director at a publishing house does when commissioning a cover illustrator. The only difference is the execution tool.

Writing one of these briefs takes **3–5 hours** of focused creative work. Then:

- **Image generation & selection**: 2–3 hours (dozens of variations, careful curation)
- **Compositing & refinement**: 1–2 hours (color grading, cleanup, enhancement)
- **Typography & layout**: 1–2 hours (font selection, placement, hierarchy, effects)
- **Final production**: 30–60 minutes (format, resolution, quality checks)

**Total time per cover: 8–12 hours of skilled professional work.**

At $150, that's **$12–$19/hour** — below minimum wage in most US states for work that requires expertise in:

- Visual composition and color theory
- Genre conventions across fiction categories
- Amazon marketplace optimization
- Typography and graphic design
- Character design and world-building translation
- Copyright law and commercial viability

### The Portfolio is Not Beginner-Level

- **22 published books** across 3 distinct series — all live on Amazon, all verifiable
- **Consistent visual identity** maintained across 12-book fantasy series (Aztec Samurai Adventures)
- **Multiple genres demonstrated** — fantasy, non-fiction, educational
- **Professional website** with examples gallery, case studies, and detailed process documentation
- **AI Transparency page** (https://metronagon.com/ai-transparency) — no other designer on Reedsy has this level of process documentation, including a real 2,800-word prompt example with the resulting cover

### The Infrastructure is Not Beginner-Level

- Custom domain and professional website (metronagon.com)
- Stripe-integrated checkout
- SEO-optimized pages with case studies
- Documented conversation pipelines for every service tier
- AI transparency and copyright documentation
- Live portfolio verifiable on Amazon

### What "Zero Reviews" Actually Means

Yes, you have zero Reedsy client reviews. But reviews measure **client satisfaction history**, not **work quality**. A designer with 50 five-star reviews for mediocre template covers is not better than a designer with zero reviews and 22 published books of exceptional quality.

The AI Transparency page alone — showing a real 2,800-word creative brief and the resulting cover — is more compelling proof of process quality than any number of star ratings.

**Clients who read that page will understand what they're paying for.**

## The Math: What Professional Rates Actually Look Like

Professional book cover designers charge based on the **value and skill** of the work, not the tool used to execute it.

| Hourly Rate | Single Cover (8–12 hrs) | 10-Book Branding (~80–100 hrs) |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| $15/hr      | $120–$180               | $1,200–$1,500                  |
| $50/hr      | $400–$600               | $4,000–$5,000                  |
| $75/hr      | $600–$900               | $6,000–$7,500                  |
| $100/hr     | $800–$1,200             | $8,000–$10,000                 |

**Your previous prices ($150/cover, $950/10-book) were $12–$19/hour territory.**

A professional rate of **$50–$75/hour** lands you squarely in the Reedsy professional range, which is exactly where the quality of your work belongs.

### Delivery Times

At professional rates, delivery times should reflect the depth of work, not signal "rush job."

| Package                  | Previous Delivery | Final Delivery    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Cover — Standard         | 1 business day    | **3–5 days**      |
| Cover — Premium          | 2 business days   | **5–7 days**      |
| Branding — 3 Books       | 2 business days   | **7–10 days**     |
| Branding — 5 Books       | 2 business days   | **10–14 days**    |
| Branding — 10 Books      | 3 business days   | **14–21 days**    |
| Children's — Standard    | 2 business days   | **10–14 days**    |
| Children's — Plus        | 2 business days   | **14–18 days**    |
| Children's — Premium     | 3 business days   | **14–21 days**    |
| Pipeline — 3 Books       | 2 business days   | **7–10 days**     |
| Pipeline — 5 Books       | 3 business days   | **10–14 days**    |
| Pipeline — 10 Books      | 4 business days   | **14–21 days**    |

**Why longer delivery times?** At professional prices, clients expect thoroughness. A "$150 cover in 1 day" signals template work. A "$450 cover in 3–5 days" signals custom craftsmanship. The work itself may not take the full window, but the **perception of care** matters.

## Why These Prices Work

### 1. They Reflect the Real Work

Each cover involves 8–12 hours of skilled work. At $450, that's $37–$56/hour — a reasonable professional rate, not an inflated ego price. The branding packages compound the value: a 10-book package at $3,500 works out to ~$350/cover, which is actually a **discount** on the individual rate.

### 2. They Signal Professional Quality

A client choosing between a $50 Fiverr cover and a $450 Metronagon cover will look at your portfolio and see the difference immediately. The price itself sets the expectation: "This is professional work, and I treat it that way."

Clients who balk at $450 are not your clients. They want cheap and fast. Clients who pay $450 want **quality** — and those are the clients who leave good reviews, come back for more books, and refer other authors.

### 3. The Portfolio Justifies the Price

Your AI Transparency page is a nuclear weapon in the pricing conversation. When a client asks "Why $450?" you send them:

- https://metronagon.com/ai-transparency — "Here's the exact creative brief I write for every cover. It's 2,800 words of custom creative direction. This is what you're paying for."
- https://metronagon.com/examples — "Here's the quality this process delivers."
- https://metronagon.com/case-studies — "Here's what a complete 12-book series looks like with consistent visual identity."

No other designer on Reedsy can show this level of process transparency. That alone is worth the price difference.

### 4. Bundle Economics Reward Commitment

| Package Type | Per-Cover Rate | Savings vs Individual |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------------------- |
| Single Cover (Standard) | $450 | — |
| Single Cover (Premium) | $650 | — |
| Branding 3-Book | ~$467/cover | Includes logo + box set |
| Branding 5-Book | ~$440/cover | Includes logo + box set |
| Branding 10-Book | ~$350/cover | Includes logo + box set |
| Pipeline 3-Book | ~$600/cover | Includes logo + box set + descriptions |
| Pipeline 5-Book | ~$560/cover | Includes logo + box set + descriptions |
| Pipeline 10-Book | ~$450/cover | Includes logo + box set + descriptions |

Larger packages offer real per-unit savings, incentivizing authors to commit to series work — which is where your strengths shine brightest.

### 5. They Leave Room to Grow

These prices sit at the **entry-to-mid point** of Reedsy's professional range. As you accumulate 5-star reviews:

- **10+ reviews**: Move covers to $550–$750, branding proportionally
- **25+ reviews**: Move to upper professional range ($700+ covers)
- **50+ reviews**: You're in the elite tier — $800+ per cover, $5,000+ for 10-book branding

You're not starting at the top. You're starting where the work quality honestly belongs, with a clear path upward.

## Addressing the "But You Have Zero Reviews" Objection

This is the only legitimate pushback on professional pricing. Here's how to handle it:

**On Reedsy:** Your profile will show zero reviews initially. But Reedsy clients can see your portfolio links, your website, and your AI Transparency page. The quality of work speaks louder than a number next to a star icon.

**In conversation:** When a potential client hesitates, your Reedsy conversation pipelines already include the AI Transparency disclosure. That page — showing a real 2,800-word prompt and the resulting cover — is the most powerful trust-builder you have. It says: "I may be new to Reedsy, but I am not new to this work."

**The alternative is worse:** Charging $150 and getting clients who expect $150 quality. Those clients are harder to please, more likely to leave mediocre reviews, and less likely to return. Starting at professional rates attracts professional clients who value quality — and those are the ones who build your review history the right way.
