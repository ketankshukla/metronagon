# How I Create Your Book Cover Art — AI Tools, Copyright, and Your Protection

## A Transparent Guide for Clients of Metronagon Media

Thank you for considering me for your book cover design. Before we begin working together, I want to be completely transparent about my creative process, the tools I use, and what that means for you and your book. This document answers every question you might have about AI-assisted design, copyright, and your rights as a client.

## What Tools Do I Use?

I use **AI-assisted image generation** as one of several tools in my professional design workflow. Specifically, I use advanced AI image generation platforms alongside traditional design software (for compositing, typography, color grading, and layout) to create your book covers.

I want to be upfront about this because **transparency is not optional — it's a core value of how I work**, and it's required by Reedsy's professional standards.

## What Does "AI-Assisted" Actually Mean?

This is the most important question, and the answer might surprise you.

When most people hear "AI-generated art," they picture someone typing a few words into a box and accepting whatever appears. That is **not** what I do. Not even close.

Here's what my process actually looks like:

### Step 1 — I Design Your Cover in Words

Before any image is generated, I write a **detailed creative brief** — typically **2,000 to 3,000 words** — that specifies every element of your cover. This includes:

- **Your character's exact appearance** — ethnicity, bone structure, skin tone, eye color (down to the color of the outer iris ring and inner striations), hair texture, style, ornamentation, facial expression, scars, and distinguishing features
- **Their clothing and equipment** — materials, construction, damage state, cultural influences, decorative elements, color palette
- **The background and setting** — specific locations from your story, architecture, landscape, weather, time of day, lighting conditions
- **The mood and atmosphere** — particle effects, light behavior, color temperature, emotional tone
- **The composition** — exact placement zones for the character, text-safe areas, depth-of-field specifications
- **The typography** — font family, exact placement, color values (specific hex codes), letter-spacing, decorative treatments, ornamental dividers

This brief is not a suggestion to the AI. It is a **comprehensive visual blueprint** — the equivalent of a detailed architectural plan that specifies every wall, window, and fixture before construction begins.

### Step 2 — I Generate and Select

Using that detailed brief, I generate multiple image candidates. Most of them don't meet my standards. I select only the outputs that best match the creative vision I've specified — often generating dozens of candidates before finding ones that work.

### Step 3 — I Refine and Produce

The selected images are then professionally finished:
- **Compositing** — combining elements from different generations for the best result
- **Color grading** — ensuring the palette matches the series vision and print/digital requirements
- **Typography** — professional text design and placement
- **Layout optimization** — ensuring the cover meets platform-specific requirements (Amazon Kindle, Apple Books, IngramSpark, print specifications)
- **Series consistency** — ensuring your cover matches the visual language of the rest of your series

The final deliverable is a **professionally produced book cover** — not a raw AI output.

## Is My Book Cover Copyrightable?

This is the question everyone asks, and here's the honest answer:

### The Current Legal Position

The US Copyright Office has said that the copyrightability of AI-assisted works depends on **how much human creative control** shaped the final result. Works created with minimal human input (a short generic prompt, no selection or refinement) may not qualify. Works where a human author exercised substantial creative direction, selection, and arrangement **do** qualify for protection.

### Where Your Cover Falls on That Spectrum

Your cover is created through a process that involves:

- **Original character design** — I design characters based on your descriptions, your story, and your vision. These characters are original creative works that exist nowhere else.
- **2,000-3,000 words of specific creative direction per image** — hundreds of individual creative decisions, all documented in writing.
- **Selection and curation** from multiple generated candidates.
- **Professional compositing, color grading, and typography** — additional layers of human creative work.
- **Series-level visual architecture** — coordinated design across all your covers that tells a unified visual story.

For context: a traditional publishing house art director typically provides **200-500 words** of creative direction to a commissioned illustrator. My creative briefs contain **5-10 times more specific creative direction** than the industry standard.

### What This Means for You

Your book cover is a **professionally produced visual asset** created under extensive human creative direction. The creative decisions — your characters, your world, your story moments, your color palette, your typography — are all human-authored. The AI is a production tool that executes that vision, similar to how a camera executes a photographer's vision or how digital brushes execute a digital painter's vision.

When you publish your book on Amazon, Apple Books, IngramSpark, or any other platform, your cover is a component of your larger copyrighted work (the book itself). There is **no legal barrier** to publishing and selling books with AI-assisted cover art on any current platform.

## What About Copyright Registration?

If you want to register your book with the US Copyright Office (which I recommend for all published works), here's what you need to know:

- **Register the book as a whole work** — text, cover, and layout together. The selection, coordination, and arrangement of all these elements is clearly human-authored.
- **Disclose AI assistance** if the registration form asks about it. Transparency is always the right approach.
- **Your text is fully copyrightable** regardless of the cover art — your written work is 100% human-authored and protected.

The strongest copyright position is always the **complete work** — your original story, your original characters, your original world, presented in a professionally designed package. That complete work is unquestionably yours.

## Will I Get Into Legal Trouble?

**No.** Here's why:

### What We're NOT Doing
- ❌ Copying existing copyrighted artwork or real people's likenesses
- ❌ Using generic, minimal prompts and selling raw AI outputs
- ❌ Hiding the use of AI tools from you or from platforms
- ❌ Claiming the images were hand-painted or traditionally illustrated

### What We ARE Doing
- ✅ Creating original character designs based on your unique story
- ✅ Writing thousands of words of specific creative direction per image
- ✅ Selecting, refining, and professionally finishing every deliverable
- ✅ Being fully transparent about the tools and process
- ✅ Ensuring every deliverable meets commercial publishing standards
- ✅ Complying with all platform requirements and Reedsy's professional policies

No current law prohibits the commercial use of AI-assisted images created with this level of human creative direction. Amazon, Apple, IngramSpark, and all major publishing platforms accept AI-assisted cover art.

## My Guarantee to You

As your designer, I make the following commitments:

1. **Full Transparency** — I will always tell you exactly what tools I use and how I use them. No surprises, no hidden processes.

2. **Commercial Viability** — Every deliverable I produce will be suitable for commercial publication on all major platforms. If any platform ever rejects a cover due to AI-related policy changes, I will remake it at no additional cost.

3. **Professional Quality** — Your covers will be indistinguishable in quality from traditionally commissioned artwork. They will be production-ready, properly formatted, and optimized for every platform you publish on.

4. **Creative Ownership** — The creative vision behind your covers — your characters, your world, your story — belongs to you. The detailed creative briefs I write are based on your intellectual property and your creative direction.

5. **Written Documentation** — You will receive a copy of the creative brief used to produce each cover, giving you a complete written record of every creative decision. This documentation strengthens your copyright position and provides a paper trail if one is ever needed.

6. **Ongoing Support** — If copyright law or platform policies change in the future, I will work with you to ensure your covers remain compliant and commercially viable.

## Why This Approach Benefits You

### Cost Efficiency
Traditional commissioned cover art for a single book typically costs **$500-$2,000+** from a professional illustrator. My AI-assisted workflow allows me to deliver **equal or superior quality** at a more accessible price point, making professional-grade cover art available to independent authors and small publishers who might otherwise settle for stock photography or template designs.

### Speed
Traditional cover commissions take **4-8 weeks**. My workflow delivers finished covers significantly faster without sacrificing quality, getting your book to market sooner.

### Precision
Because I can generate and iterate rapidly, I can explore **far more creative options** than a traditional illustrator working within a fixed revision budget. If a concept isn't working, I can pivot quickly. If you want to see a different color palette, a different pose, or a different mood, I can produce alternatives rapidly.

### Consistency
For series authors, maintaining visual consistency across multiple books is critical. My detailed creative brief system ensures that characters look consistent across every cover, that the color palette evolves deliberately, and that your series has a unified, professional visual identity.

## What Happens Next?

If you'd like to proceed, here's how it works:

1. **You confirm** that you've read this document and you're comfortable with my AI-assisted workflow.
2. **I'll ask you for written consent** — a simple confirmation that you understand and approve the use of AI tools in creating your cover art. This is required by Reedsy's professional standards and it protects both of us.
3. **We begin the creative process** — I'll gather your book details, character descriptions, mood preferences, and any reference images you'd like me to consider.
4. **I produce your covers** using the detailed creative brief process described above.
5. **You receive final deliverables** — production-ready files optimized for every platform you publish on, along with the creative brief documentation.

## Questions?

I welcome any questions you have about this process. Transparency is the foundation of how I work, and I'd rather you ask now than wonder later. There are no bad questions when it comes to understanding how your book's visual identity is being created.

If you'd like to see an example of the level of detail in my creative briefs, I'm happy to share a sample prompt alongside the finished cover it produced. Seeing the 2,500-word brief next to the final image is usually the moment when clients realize this is not "AI slapping something together" — it's a sophisticated, directed creative process with a human author at the controls.
