# REQUEST: Create My Book Series Template Repository

Read the file `prompt-1-template-repo-creator.md` in this project root. It contains extremely detailed instructions for what I need you to build.

## What I need you to do:

1. **Read the entire prompt file** at `prompt-1-template-repo-creator.md` in this directory — it has the full specification
2. **Deep-scan my 3 existing book series projects** on the E:\ drive:
   - `E:\aztec-samurai-adventures` (fiction, 12-book epic fantasy)
   - `E:\repetition-mother-of-mastery` (non-fiction, 5-book educational series)
   - `E:\reality-without-belief` (non-fiction, 5-book philosophical series)
3. **Analyze every directory, file, naming convention, content format, website component, image prompt structure, and publishing pattern** across all three projects
4. **Create a brand-new reusable template repository** at `E:\book-series-template` that captures the best patterns from all three projects — this template must work for both fiction and non-fiction series of any size
5. **The template must include:** a fully functional Next.js website with parameterized components, fill-in-the-blank planning documents, image prompt templates matching my existing ultra-detailed format, front/back matter templates, PowerShell DOCX generation scripts, Amazon KDP publishing templates, video script templates, and proper git initialization
6. **Verify the build works** — run `npm install` and `npm run build` to confirm the website compiles

The prompt file has the complete directory structure, every file that needs to be created, and all the critical requirements. Follow it precisely. Take your time — scan all three projects thoroughly before creating anything.
