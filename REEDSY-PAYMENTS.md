# How Reedsy Pays Freelancers
## The Complete Payment Structure, Timeline, and What to Expect

---

## Part 1 — Reedsy's Commission Structure

Reedsy charges a **10% collaboration fee from the freelancer** and a **separate 10% service fee from the client**. These are two distinct charges — you are not splitting a single 20% fee.

**What this means in practice:**

- You quote a project at **$500**
- Reedsy deducts **$50 (10%)** from your side
- You receive **$450**
- The client pays **$550** (your $500 quote + their 10% fee)

**The formula to quote on Reedsy if you want to net a specific amount:**

If you want to net **$X**, quote **$X ÷ 0.90** on Reedsy.

| You Want to Net | Quote on Reedsy |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| $99 | $110 |
| $175 | $195 |
| $275 | $306 |
| $425 | $473 |
| $475 | $528 |
| $500 | $556 |
| $650 | $723 |
| $750 | $834 |
| $1,000 | $1,112 |
| $1,400 | $1,556 |

**Practical advice:** Most Reedsy freelancers simply raise their standard rates by 10–15% when quoting on Reedsy to compensate for the commission, while keeping their quoted price competitive with the Reedsy market (which already prices significantly higher than most direct freelance rates). See `REEDSY-COMPETITIVE-PRICES.md` for how Reedsy's market rates compare to your current pricing.

## Part 2 — How Payments Are Structured Within a Project

Reedsy uses a **milestone-based payment system**. When you submit an offer to a client, you set the payment schedule as part of that offer. You define:

- How many milestones the project has
- When each milestone is due
- How much each milestone is worth

**The most common structure for design projects:**

| Milestone | When | Amount |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Milestone 1 (Deposit) | Project start | 50% of total |
| Milestone 2 (Final Delivery) | Delivery of final files | 50% of total |

**For larger projects (branding, pipeline, children's books):**

| Milestone | When | Amount |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Milestone 1 | Project kickoff | 30% |
| Milestone 2 | Mid-project (e.g., concepts approved) | 40% |
| Milestone 3 | Final delivery | 30% |

You set this schedule yourself in your offer. Reedsy does not impose a specific milestone structure — you have full control. The client must accept your offer (including the payment schedule) before the project begins.

**Setting the payment schedule in your offer:**
When writing a project offer through the Reedsy messaging system, you will see a section where you can add milestones, assign amounts and due dates. This is where you configure everything before the client accepts.

## Part 3 — When Reedsy Releases Funds to You

Reedsy holds all client payments in **escrow** (a secure holding account) until the work at each milestone is delivered and approved. The client pays each milestone amount upfront — it is held by Reedsy, not released to you, until delivery.

**The payment release sequence:**

1. **Client accepts your offer** → Reedsy charges the client for Milestone 1 immediately. The funds are held in escrow.
2. **You complete and deliver Milestone 1 work** → You mark it as delivered in the Reedsy platform.
3. **Client reviews and approves** → Reedsy releases the Milestone 1 funds from escrow to your Reedsy account.
4. **Client is charged for Milestone 2** → Reedsy charges the client for the next milestone once the previous one is approved.
5. **Repeat until final milestone** → Final delivery → client approves → final payment released.

**The 14-day auto-release rule:**

If the client does not approve or request revisions within **14 days** of you marking a milestone as delivered, Reedsy automatically releases the funds to your account. This protects freelancers from clients who go silent after receiving work.

This is one of Reedsy's most important protections for freelancers — you will get paid even if the client becomes unresponsive.

**If the client requests a revision:**
The 14-day clock resets. The funds remain in escrow until the revision is delivered and approved (or the new 14-day window expires).

## Part 4 — Withdrawing Your Money

Once funds are released to your **Reedsy account balance**, you can withdraw them to your bank account or PayPal.

**Withdrawal methods:**
- **Bank transfer (ACH)** — Direct bank deposit. Available in the US and most supported countries. Free.
- **PayPal** — Standard PayPal transfer. Available internationally. PayPal may charge their own transfer fees.
- **International wire transfer** — Available for non-US freelancers. Fees vary by country and bank.

**How long it takes:**
- Withdrawal request → typically **3–7 business days** to arrive in your bank account
- PayPal transfers are usually faster (1–3 business days)

**Minimum withdrawal:**
There is a minimum balance required before you can withdraw — this varies but is typically around **$20–$50**. Once you exceed the minimum, you can initiate a withdrawal at any time.

**UK-specific note:**
A 20% VAT is applied to Reedsy's service fee for UK-based freelancers. This does not affect US-based freelancers.

## Part 5 — Payment Protection: What Reedsy Guarantees

Reedsy's payment system provides significant protection for freelancers compared to working with clients directly:

**What Reedsy protects you from:**
- Clients disappearing after receiving work (14-day auto-release handles this)
- Non-payment disputes (funds are already in escrow when the project starts)
- Chargebacks (Reedsy manages payment disputes, not you)
- International payment complications (Reedsy handles the currency conversion)

**What you are still responsible for:**
- Delivering work that matches your offer description
- Responding to revision requests within a reasonable time
- Setting clear scope boundaries in your offer (scope creep is not covered by Reedsy)

**Reedsy dispute resolution:**
If a client disputes delivery, Reedsy has a support team that mediates. Having your offer clearly written — with specific deliverables and revision limits defined — is your strongest protection in any dispute.

## Part 6 — Practical Notes for Managing Reedsy Projects

**Always get the deposit milestone paid before starting work.** Your offer should include a first milestone due at project start. Never begin work on a Reedsy project without the first milestone funds confirmed in escrow.

**Mark milestones as delivered promptly.** The 14-day clock doesn't start until you mark the milestone as delivered. Don't wait — mark it delivered when you send the files.

**Keep revision scope in your offer.** Specify the number of revision rounds in your offer text. If a client asks for more, you can quote an additional charge. Without this in your offer, revision scope disputes are harder to resolve.

**Reedsy messaging is your record.** All project communication should happen through Reedsy's messaging system. This creates a written record that Reedsy can reference if there's ever a dispute.

**Tax reporting.** Reedsy earnings are freelance income and must be reported on your taxes. Reedsy will issue a 1099-K (US) if you exceed the IRS reporting threshold. Keep records of all project earnings for your own accounting regardless.

## Part 7 — The Reedsy Application Process

Reedsy is a **curated marketplace** — not everyone who applies is accepted. They review applications and only accept freelancers who meet their quality standards.

**To apply:**
1. Go to `reedsy.com/freelancer`
2. Create a freelancer account
3. Complete your profile (bio, expertise, services offered)
4. Submit your portfolio for review

**What Reedsy looks for:**
- A professional portfolio with demonstrated work quality
- Experience in book publishing specifically (not just general design)
- Clear specialization (cover design, interior formatting, illustration, etc.)
- A professional profile presentation

**For your Reedsy application:** Your portfolio — which includes three complete author series websites, 22 books across three published series, a complete 32-page children's picture book, cover designs across multiple genres, and series branding work — is exceptionally strong for a Reedsy application. Reference your live sites (`aztec.ketanshukla.com`, `repetition.ketanshukla.com`, `reality.ketanshukla.com`) as live examples.

**Review timeline:** Reedsy typically reviews applications within 1–2 weeks. Approval is not guaranteed, but strong portfolios are accepted.
