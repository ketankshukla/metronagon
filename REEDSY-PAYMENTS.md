# How Reedsy Pays Freelancers

## The Complete Payment Structure, Timeline, and What to Expect

---

## Part 1 — Reedsy's Commission Structure

Reedsy charges a **10% collaboration fee from the freelancer** and a **separate 10% service fee from the client**. These are two distinct charges — you are not splitting a single 20% fee.

**What this means in practice:**

- You quote a project at **$500**
- Reedsy deducts **$50 (10%)** from your side
- You receive **$450**
- The client pays **$550** (your $500 quote + their 10% fee)

**The formula to quote on Reedsy if you want to net a specific amount:**

If you want to net **$X**, quote **$X ÷ 0.90** on Reedsy.

| You Want to Net | Quote on Reedsy |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| $99             | $110            |
| $175            | $195            |
| $275            | $306            |
| $425            | $473            |
| $475            | $528            |
| $500            | $556            |
| $650            | $723            |
| $750            | $834            |
| $1,000          | $1,112          |
| $1,400          | $1,556          |

**Practical advice:** Most Reedsy freelancers simply raise their standard rates by 10–15% when quoting on Reedsy to compensate for the commission, while keeping their quoted price competitive with the Reedsy market (which already prices significantly higher than most direct freelance rates). See `REEDSY-COMPETITIVE-PRICES.md` for how Reedsy's market rates compare to your current pricing.

## Part 1b — Reedsy's Tiered Discount Structure (Loyalty Discounts)

Reedsy reduces the commission rate as your total transaction history with a **specific client** grows. This is calculated per client relationship, not across all your earnings.

| Cumulative amount with that client | Commission rate (each side) |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| $0 – $5,000                        | 10%                         |
| $5,001 – $10,000                   | 9%                          |
| $10,001 – $15,000                  | 8%                          |
| $15,001 and above                  | 7%                          |

**What this means in practice:** A returning client who has spent $6,000 with you historically will trigger the 9% bracket, meaning Reedsy takes 9% from you and 9% from them on the next collaboration instead of 10%.

**The calculation works like tax brackets in reverse:** the more a client has spent with you cumulatively, the lower the rate on all amounts above each threshold. Reedsy handles this calculation automatically — you do not need to track it manually.

**This is a significant incentive to build repeat client relationships on Reedsy.** A client who commissions an ongoing series across multiple projects will move through these brackets over time, meaning both you and the client pay progressively less commission on each collaboration.

## Part 2 — How Payments Are Structured Within a Project

Reedsy uses a **milestone-based payment system**. When you submit an offer to a client, you set the payment schedule as part of that offer. You define:

- How many milestones the project has
- When each milestone is due
- How much each milestone is worth

**The most common structure for design projects:**

| Milestone                    | When                    | Amount       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| Milestone 1 (Deposit)        | Project start           | 50% of total |
| Milestone 2 (Final Delivery) | Delivery of final files | 50% of total |

**For larger projects (branding, pipeline, children's books):**

| Milestone   | When                                  | Amount |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Milestone 1 | Project kickoff                       | 30%    |
| Milestone 2 | Mid-project (e.g., concepts approved) | 40%    |
| Milestone 3 | Final delivery                        | 30%    |

You set this schedule yourself in your offer. Reedsy does not impose a specific milestone structure — you have full control. The client must accept your offer (including the payment schedule) before the project begins.

**Setting the payment schedule in your offer:**
When writing a project offer through the Reedsy messaging system, you will see a section where you can add milestones, assign amounts and due dates. This is where you configure everything before the client accepts.

## Part 3 — When Reedsy Releases Funds to You

Reedsy holds all client payments in **escrow** (a secure holding account) until the work at each milestone is delivered and approved. The client pays each milestone amount upfront — it is held by Reedsy, not released to you, until delivery.

**The payment release sequence:**

1. **Client accepts your offer** → Reedsy charges the client for Milestone 1 immediately. The funds are held in escrow.
2. **You complete and deliver Milestone 1 work** → You mark it as delivered in the Reedsy platform.
3. **Client reviews and approves** → Reedsy releases the Milestone 1 funds from escrow to your Reedsy account.
4. **Client is charged for Milestone 2** → Reedsy charges the client for the next milestone once the previous one is approved.
5. **Repeat until final milestone** → Final delivery → client approves → final payment released.

**The 14-day auto-release rule:**

If the client does not approve or request revisions within **14 days** of you marking a milestone as delivered, Reedsy automatically releases the funds to your account. This protects freelancers from clients who go silent after receiving work.

This is one of Reedsy's most important protections for freelancers — you will get paid even if the client becomes unresponsive.

**If the client requests a revision:**
The 14-day clock resets. The funds remain in escrow until the revision is delivered and approved (or the new 14-day window expires).

## Part 4 — How You Actually Receive Your Money (Stripe)

Reedsy uses **Stripe** as its payment processor. This is a critical detail: you do **not** manually withdraw money from a Reedsy account balance. Instead, Stripe automatically transfers your earnings directly to your linked bank account as each payment milestone clears.

**How it works:**

1. You connect your bank account to Stripe once during setup (Account Settings → Billing & Payments → Connect to Stripe).
2. When a payment milestone is approved and clears, Stripe automatically moves your share to your bank account.
3. No manual withdrawal steps required — you are simply paid on the payment dates set in your project schedule.

**Setting up Stripe:**

- Go to your Reedsy Account Settings
- Click **Billing & Payments** on the upper left
- Click **Connect to Stripe** and follow the prompts
- When completing sign-up, include your first and last name in both the 'public business name' and 'statement descriptor' fields — this helps clients recognize charges on their bank statements and prevents unnecessary disputes

**Stripe transaction fees:**
Stripe charges a small processing fee (a fixed percentage plus a per-transaction amount) that varies by country. This is separate from Reedsy's 10% commission. Check Stripe's pricing page for your country: for the US, the standard Stripe rate is 2.9% + $0.30 per successful charge.

**Supported countries:**
You must have a bank account in a Stripe-supported country. Supported countries include: US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, most of the Eurozone, and several others. You do not need to be a resident/citizen of the country — you just need a bank account there.

**UK-specific note:**
A 20% VAT is applied to Reedsy's service fee for UK-based freelancers. This does not affect US-based freelancers.

## Part 5 — Payment Protection: What Reedsy Guarantees

Reedsy's payment system provides significant protection for freelancers compared to working with clients directly:

**What Reedsy protects you from:**

- Clients disappearing after receiving work (14-day auto-release handles this)
- Non-payment disputes (funds are already in escrow when the project starts)
- Chargebacks (Reedsy manages payment disputes, not you)
- International payment complications (Reedsy handles the currency conversion)

**What you are still responsible for:**

- Delivering work that matches your offer description
- Responding to revision requests within a reasonable time
- Setting clear scope boundaries in your offer (scope creep is not covered by Reedsy)

**Reedsy dispute resolution:**
If a client disputes delivery, Reedsy has a support team that mediates. Having your offer clearly written — with specific deliverables and revision limits defined — is your strongest protection in any dispute.

## Part 6 — Practical Notes for Managing Reedsy Projects

**Always get the deposit milestone paid before starting work.** Your offer should include a first milestone due at project start. Never begin work on a Reedsy project without the first milestone funds confirmed in escrow.

**Mark milestones as delivered promptly.** The 14-day clock doesn't start until you mark the milestone as delivered. Don't wait — mark it delivered when you send the files.

**Keep revision scope in your offer.** Specify the number of revision rounds in your offer text. If a client asks for more, you can quote an additional charge. Without this in your offer, revision scope disputes are harder to resolve.

**Reedsy messaging is your record.** All project communication should happen through Reedsy's messaging system. This creates a written record that Reedsy can reference if there's ever a dispute.

**Tax reporting.** Reedsy earnings are freelance income and must be reported on your taxes. Reedsy will issue a 1099-K (US) if you exceed the IRS reporting threshold. Keep records of all project earnings for your own accounting regardless.

**Amending payment schedules.** If a project timeline shifts after the client has accepted your offer, you can submit a payment schedule amendment through the Collaborations panel. Rules: amendments must be submitted at least **3 days** before any upcoming payment date, and they expire **24 hours** before that payment date (so the client must accept before then). Changing start/end project dates does NOT automatically shift payment dates — you must update those separately in the amendment.

## Part 6b — The AI Disclosure Requirement (Read This Before Applying)

Reedsy has an explicit policy on the use of generative AI. This is documented in their Project Protection policy and applies to all freelancers on the marketplace.

**Reedsy's policy (verbatim):**

> Any use of generative AI must be disclosed to the client prior to the start of the collaboration, and the scope should be clearly defined and delimited in offers. A designer planning on using an AI image generation tool to create cover concepts must inform the client in their offer or message and obtain the client's written consent before proceeding.

**What this means for you:** If any part of your workflow involves AI image generation tools, you are required to disclose this to each client in your written offer and obtain their explicit written consent before beginning work. Failing to disclose and a client later discovering AI involvement is grounds for a dispute and potential account action.

**In practice:** Include a clear, professional disclosure statement in your offer template for any service where AI tools are part of the process. Keep the client's consent confirmation in the Reedsy messaging thread as your record.

**Copyright note:** Reedsy also flags that AI-generated works may face copyright uncertainty. Work produced entirely by generative AI without sufficient human authorship may not be protectable under current US copyright law. This is worth understanding before representing deliverables as fully original works.

## Part 7 — The Reedsy Application Process

Reedsy is a **curated marketplace** — not everyone who applies is accepted. They review applications and only accept freelancers who meet their quality standards.

**To apply:**

1. Go to `reedsy.com/freelancer`
2. Create a freelancer account
3. Complete your profile (bio, expertise, services offered)
4. Submit your portfolio for review

**What Reedsy looks for:**

- A professional portfolio with demonstrated work quality
- Experience in book publishing specifically (not just general design)
