# AI Disclosure — What to Say on Reedsy
## Professional Disclosure Language for Client Offers and Conversations

Reedsy requires that any use of AI image generation tools be disclosed in your offer and that the client gives written consent before work begins. This document gives you the exact language to use — written to be transparent, professional, and positioned in a way that demonstrates expertise rather than undermining it.

---

## Part 1 — The Mandatory Disclosure Block (Paste Into Every Offer)

This goes at the bottom of every offer you write on Reedsy, clearly labeled so the client sees it before accepting. Keep it short, plain, and confident — not apologetic.

---

### Version A — Standard (for cover design, branding, pipeline packages)

> **A note on my workflow and tools:**
>
> My cover and branding work is produced using a combination of advanced AI image generation tools and extensive manual post-processing. The creative direction — genre research, visual concept development, composition, typography, color treatment, and print-ready formatting — is my own work throughout. AI image generation is one tool in a broader design process that also involves significant manual craft and publishing expertise.
>
> In line with Reedsy's policy, I'm disclosing this upfront. By accepting this offer, you confirm you're comfortable with this workflow. If you have any questions about the process before we begin, I'm happy to walk you through it in detail.

---

### Version B — For children's book illustration packages

> **A note on my workflow and tools:**
>
> My children's book illustration work is produced using advanced AI image generation tools alongside significant manual direction, curation, and refinement. Character consistency, page-by-page composition, text placement, print-ready formatting, and the assembled final PDF are all produced with hands-on craft. The visual development process involves many iterations, review passes, and deliberate choices at every stage — the tools assist with image generation, but every decision about what the book looks like is mine.
>
> As required by Reedsy's policy, I'm disclosing this upfront. By accepting this offer, you confirm you're comfortable with this approach. Questions about the process are welcome before we start.

---

### Version C — Minimal (for simpler services: audiobook cover adaptations, print wraps, social media packs)

> **Workflow note:** This work involves AI-assisted image generation as part of the design process, with manual post-processing, layout, and formatting. Disclosed per Reedsy's policy. Acceptance of this offer constitutes your consent to proceed.

---

## Part 2 — How to Explain Your Workflow (Pitch Language)

Use this when a client asks how you work, or when you want to proactively describe your process in the offer body itself — before the disclosure block. This is not the disclosure; it's the part that demonstrates your expertise.

---

### The "How I Work" Paragraph (paste into offer body, above the disclosure)

> My process begins long before any image is created. I start with genre research — studying the visual conventions of your specific category to understand what signals "this is your kind of book" to the right reader. I look at current bestsellers in your genre on Amazon, identify what's working visually, and determine how your book should stand out while still belonging to its genre shelf.
>
> From there, I develop a detailed creative brief based on your project: the mood, the palette, the compositional approach, the typography treatment. This is the creative direction stage — and it's where experience matters most. I've published twenty-two books across three series and designed the covers, branding, and websites for all of them. I know what makes a cover work because I've been through the full production and publishing process myself, not just the design side.
>
> The image generation stage uses advanced tools to produce the visual elements — but what I generate is only as good as the direction behind it. The difference between generic AI output and a professional cover isn't the tool; it's knowing exactly what to ask for, how to evaluate what comes back, and how to push it until it's right. I run dozens of iterations on every project. I reject a lot. What you receive is what survived a rigorous selection and refinement process.
>
> After image generation, the manual work begins: typography, layout, composition adjustments, color grading, print-ready export (300 DPI, CMYK color profile, correct bleed and margin specifications for Amazon KDP). None of that is automated. The final file you receive is production-ready and tested against Amazon's current specifications before delivery.

## Part 3 — If a Client Asks Directly: "Is This AI-Generated?"

You will be asked this. Have a confident, honest answer ready. Do not be defensive — own it as part of your professional toolkit.

---

### Short answer (for quick messages):

> Yes — I use AI image generation tools as part of my workflow, combined with manual creative direction, typography, post-processing, and print-ready formatting. It's a professional toolkit, not a shortcut. The creative decisions — what the cover looks like, why it works for your genre, how it's composed — those are mine. Happy to explain more about the process if it would help.

---

### Longer answer (if the client seems uncertain):

> That's a fair question and I'm glad you asked. Yes, AI image generation is part of how I produce covers, and I disclose that in every offer — Reedsy requires it and I think clients deserve to know.
>
> What I'd push back on gently is the assumption that "AI-generated" means "low effort." The quality of an AI-generated cover depends entirely on the expertise behind the direction. I've been through the full publishing process myself — I'm a published author with twenty-two books across three series, all designed, branded, and published through Amazon KDP. I know what a professionally published book looks like because I've produced them. That knowledge is what I bring to your project.
>
> I run extensive iterations on every cover, apply serious genre research before touching any tools, and do all the post-processing, typography, layout, and print-ready formatting manually. What I deliver is a production-ready file that has been tested against Amazon KDP's current specifications — not a raw image that happens to look nice.
>
> The proof is in the work. I can share my published covers and branding across all three of my series if you'd like to see what the process actually produces.

## Part 4 — What to Emphasize and What to Avoid

### Lead with these strengths:

- **You are a published author.** Twenty-two books across three series, all through Amazon KDP. You don't just design covers — you understand the full journey from manuscript to published product. Most designers on Reedsy have never published a book themselves.
- **Your genre expertise is real.** You've designed covers and branding across epic fantasy, narrative nonfiction, and philosophy/self-help. You know what the Amazon shelf for each of those looks like.
- **Your technical knowledge is hands-on.** You understand KDP Print specifications, Kindle formatting, CMYK color profiles, bleed, spine calculation. These are not abstract concepts to you — you've worked with them on your own books.
- **Your portfolio is live.** Your three series websites (`aztec.ketanshukla.com`, `repetition.ketanshukla.com`, `reality.ketanshukla.com`) and the books on your Amazon author page are real, published, live work. A client can see exactly what you produce.
- **You direct the process.** Prompt engineering, visual direction, and iteration judgment are genuine creative skills. The number of decisions made between "start project" and "deliver final file" is large — the tools don't make those decisions.

### Don't say:

- "I just use AI" (even if someone asks, this framing undersells everything around the AI)
- "It's easy" or "fast" (even if it sometimes is — price reflects value, not time)
- "Anyone could do this" (they can't — your expertise is the differentiator)
- Anything that sounds apologetic about using advanced tools (photographers use cameras; designers use software; this is no different)

## Part 5 — The Copyright Reality (Know This Before Any Client Asks)

Reedsy's policy and current US copyright law both flag that work produced primarily by AI tools without sufficient human authorship may have limited copyright protectability. This is worth understanding so you're not caught off guard.

**What this means practically:**

- You cannot guarantee copyright protection on AI-generated visual elements the way a traditionally commissioned illustration would be protected
- The human-authored elements of your deliverables — typography, layout, composition choices, text elements, print formatting, any manual modifications — are copyrightable
- The overall design as a creative work may receive some protection depending on the degree of human creative input

**How to handle it if a client asks about copyright:**

> The cover design I deliver to you is yours to use for your book — commercially, for print, for all Amazon KDP formats, for promotional materials. You can register copyright on the overall book cover as a combined work. For the specific underlying images, copyright status for AI-generated artwork is an evolving legal area. I'd recommend speaking with a publishing attorney if this is a concern for you, but for the vast majority of self-publishing authors, this has no practical impact on their ability to publish and sell their book.

## Part 6 — One-Sentence Summary (Use This in Your Reedsy Profile Bio)

If Reedsy allows a short description of your approach on your profile, this positions you accurately without leading with "AI":

> *I combine advanced creative tools, deep Amazon publishing experience, and hands-on post-production craft to deliver print-ready covers, branding, and full production packages for self-publishing authors — backed by twenty-two published books of my own across three series.*
