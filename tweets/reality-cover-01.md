# Reality Without Belief — Book 1 Cover

## Tweet Text

```
Book 1 of Reality Without Belief.

The opening cover of a 5-book series. It has to hook readers AND set the visual tone for everything that follows.

This is what intentional design looks like — not just a pretty image, but a strategic brand asset.
