# Children's Picture Book — Closing Pages

## Tweet Text

```
The final pages of a children's book should feel like a warm hug.

The resolution. The lesson. The moment the child looks up and says "again!"

These closing pages are designed to land with emotion — and to make this book the one they reach for at bedtime.
