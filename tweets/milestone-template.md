### First Sale

Just completed my first client project at Metronagon Media. ✦

[X] covers designed. Client is thrilled. This is just the beginning.

If you're an indie author who needs professional book covers, I'd love to work with you.

### 10th Client
```
10 clients in. [X] covers designed. [X] series branded.

Every project teaches me something new. Every author brings a unique vision. I'm grateful for every one of them.

Here's to the next 10. And the 10 after that.

## Notes

- Milestone posts humanize your brand
- They perform well because people love rooting for small businesses
- Post them authentically — don't exaggerate numbers
