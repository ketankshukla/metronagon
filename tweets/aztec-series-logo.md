# Aztec Chronicles — Series Logo

The Aztec Chronicles series logo.

A series logo isn't optional — it's the anchor of your entire brand. It appears on every cover, every box set, every piece of marketing. It's what makes 12 individual books feel like one unified product.

Series branding includes a custom logo, and it's included in every branding package.
