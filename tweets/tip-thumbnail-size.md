# Educational Tweet — Thumbnail Test

## Tweet Text

```
The thumbnail test every author needs to do:

1. Open your book cover
2. Shrink it to the size of a postage stamp
3. Can you still read the title?
4. Can you still tell the genre?
5. Does it still look professional?

If the answer to any of these is "no," your cover is failing on Amazon — because that's the size readers see it at in search results.

Design for the thumbnail first. Always.
