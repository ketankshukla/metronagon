# Children's Picture Book — Full Showcase

```
I illustrated a complete 32-page children's picture book.

Every page. Every character. Every scene. Consistent art style from cover to cover.

This is what a professional children's book looks like when it's designed with intention — not cobbled together from random AI images.
