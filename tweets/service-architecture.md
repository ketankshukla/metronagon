Most series fall apart by Book 3 because they were never planned.

Series architecture from Metronagon Media gives you:

✦ Complete series arc across all books
✦ Chapter outlines (10–15 per book)
✦ Cross-book continuity plan
✦ Amazon-optimized book descriptions
✦ Front/back matter strategy

3 Books — $200
5 Books — $350
8+ Books — $800

Plan once. Write with confidence.
