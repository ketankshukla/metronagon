# Thread — Complete Children's Picture Book Process

## Tweet 1/8 (Thread Opener)

```
I illustrated a complete 32-page children's picture book.

Every page. Every character. Consistent art style from cover to final page.

Here's what the process looks like — and what you get when you order one.

It starts with the story.

You either bring your own manuscript or I write/adapt one for you. We lock in the target age group, the characters, the settings, and the emotional arc.

The story drives every illustration decision.

Pages 1–8: Setting the world.

The opening pages establish the art style, the color palette, and the characters. Every illustration from here forward stays consistent with these first pages.

That consistency is what makes it feel like a real published book — not a collection of random AI images.

Pages 9–16: The adventure builds.

Bigger scenes. More action. More emotion. The illustrations carry the story — because at this age, kids are reading the pictures more than the words.

Every page is full-color, full-bleed. No shortcuts.

Pages 17–24: The climax.

This is where the story peaks. The illustrations have to hit the emotional high point — the bravest moment, the funniest scene, the biggest surprise.

The art style stays locked. The energy amplifies.

Pages 25–32: The resolution.

The final pages should feel like a warm hug. The lesson lands. The child looks up and says "again!"

These closing pages are designed to make this book the one they reach for at bedtime.

If you have a children's book idea — a story for your kid, your grandkid, or the world — I can turn it into a real, published book.
