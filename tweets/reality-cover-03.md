# Reality Without Belief — Book 3 Cover

## Tweet Text

```
Book 3 of Reality Without Belief.

The midpoint of a 5-book series. The cover shifts just enough to signal escalation — but stays anchored to the brand.

Readers should feel the story intensifying just by looking at the covers in sequence.
