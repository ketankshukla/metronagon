# Children's Picture Book — Opening Pages

## Tweet Text

```
The opening pages of a children's picture book set the entire tone.

Bright. Warm. Inviting. The art style has to make a child want to turn the page — and make a parent want to read it aloud.

These pages were designed for both.

Children's picture books from $500. Standard: 5-day delivery. Premium: 7-day delivery.
