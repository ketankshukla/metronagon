# Educational Tweet — Why Series Branding Matters

## Tweet Text

```
Why series branding matters more than individual covers:

A reader sees Book 1 → likes the cover → buys it → finishes it → goes back to Amazon.

If Books 2–5 look like they belong to the same world, that reader buys ALL of them. If they look random, they hesitate.

Consistent branding = higher read-through rate = more revenue per reader.

This is why I design entire series as a system, not individual covers in isolation.
