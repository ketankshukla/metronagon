# Aztec Chronicles — Book 11 Cover Reveal

```
Book 11 of The Aztec Chronicles.

The penultimate cover. One book left after this. The tension in the story should be mirrored in the cover — and it is.

Darker. Bolder. More urgent. The visual language shifts just enough to signal: the climax is here.
