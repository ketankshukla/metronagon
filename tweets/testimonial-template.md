# Testimonial Tweet Template

Use this template whenever you receive a positive client review or message.

## Tweet Text Template

```
"[Client quote here]"

— [Client name], author of [book/series name]

Nothing makes this work more rewarding than hearing a client is thrilled with the result.

## Image to Attach

The cover(s) you designed for that client (with their permission).

## Notes

- ALWAYS get permission before posting client work or quotes
- Tag the client's X handle if they have one — they'll often retweet
- Social proof is the #1 trust signal for new customers
- Save every positive DM, email, or review — each one is content
