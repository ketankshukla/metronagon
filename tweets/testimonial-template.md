The cover(s) you designed for that client (with their permission).

## Notes

- ALWAYS get permission before posting client work or quotes
- Tag the client's X handle if they have one — they'll often retweet
- Social proof is the #1 trust signal for new customers
- Save every positive DM, email, or review — each one is content
