# Engagement Tweet — Genre Poll

## Tweet Text

```
Authors — which genre's book covers are the HARDEST to get right?
```

## Poll Options (X allows 4 options)

1. Fantasy / Sci-Fi
2. Romance
3. Thriller / Mystery
4. Children's / Picture Book

## Notes

- Polls get 2–3x more engagement than regular tweets
- Reply to every vote with a follow-up comment
- After the poll ends, post a follow-up thread breaking down WHY the winning genre is hardest

## No image needed — polls perform better without images
