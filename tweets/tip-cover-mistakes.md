5 book cover mistakes that are killing your sales:

1. Too much text — your cover isn't a synopsis
2. Wrong genre signals — readers judge genre by cover in 0.3 seconds
3. DIY typography — bad font choice screams "self-published"
4. No series consistency — 5 books that look like 5 different series
5. Low resolution — blurry thumbnails = instant skip

Your cover is your #1 marketing asset. Treat it like one.
