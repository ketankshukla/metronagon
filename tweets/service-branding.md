# Service Promo — Series Branding

## Tweet Text

```
A book is a product. A series is a brand.

If your 5-book series has 5 covers that look like they were designed by 5 different people, you're leaving money on the table.

Series branding from Metronagon Media:

✦ 3 Books — $250
✦ 5 Books — $500
✦ 8+ Books — $1,200

Covers. Logo. Box set. Style guide. All unified.
