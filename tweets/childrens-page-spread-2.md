# Children's Picture Book — Middle Pages

## Tweet Text

```
The middle of a children's book is where the adventure peaks.

Bigger scenes. More action. More emotion. The illustrations have to carry the story — because at this age, kids are reading the pictures more than the words.

Every page is a full-color, full-bleed illustration. No shortcuts.
