# Thread — The Aztec Chronicles: All 12 Covers

## Tweet 1/14 (Thread Opener)

```
I designed 12 book covers for a single dark fantasy series — from scratch.

Every cover. The series logo. Box sets. Character portraits. A complete visual identity.

This is The Aztec Chronicles. Here's every cover and the story behind the design.

Book 1 — The cover that sets the tone for everything.

Dark palette. Cinematic lighting. Gold accents. Every design decision here becomes the foundation for 11 more covers.

Get Book 1 wrong and the entire series suffers. Get it right and everything flows from here.

Books 2 & 3 — Building the visual language.

Same typography grid. Same color temperature. Same lighting direction. Different subjects, same world.

By Book 3, readers see the cover and instantly know: "This is an Aztec Chronicles book."

Books 4–6 — The middle of the series.

The covers evolve just enough to reflect escalation in the story, but the brand stays locked. Darker edges. More intensity. More weight.

Consistency doesn't mean sameness — it means controlled evolution.

Books 7–9 — The second half.

This is where weaker series start to lose visual cohesion. Random designers, changing styles, inconsistent quality.

Not here. 9 books deep and the visual identity is rock solid.

Books 10–12 — The finale.

12 covers. 1 designer. 1 vision. From the opening book to the series closer, every cover tells the reader: "This series was built with intention."

The series logo — the anchor.

This appears on every cover, every box set, every piece of marketing. It's what turns 12 individual products into one unified brand.

A series logo isn't optional. It's the most important branding asset you own.

Box sets — the wide-format cinematic pieces.

When readers binge a series, they want the box set. And the box set cover has to feel like an event — a panoramic snapshot of the entire world.

The complete series cover — all 12 books in one panoramic image.

This is the hero asset. It goes on the author page, the website, the YouTube thumbnail, the marketing materials. It IS the series.

Character portraits — bringing the cast to life.

Every major character gets a full portrait. Consistent style, consistent world, intentional lighting, costume design, and personality.

These aren't random AI images — they're designed characters.

More characters from The Aztec Chronicles.

Each portrait is generated with a consistent style reference to ensure visual continuity. Same art direction. Same lighting setup. Same level of detail.
