# Educational Tweet — Genre Signals

## Tweet Text

```
Your book cover's job is NOT to be "pretty."

Its job is to signal the correct genre in 0.3 seconds.

Fantasy readers expect: dark tones, metallic textures, epic figures
Romance readers expect: soft lighting, warm colors, character chemistry
Thriller readers expect: stark contrast, bold sans-serif type, tension

If your fantasy novel looks like a romance, fantasy readers skip it AND romance readers feel tricked.

Genre-accurate covers sell. Pretty covers that miss the genre don't.
