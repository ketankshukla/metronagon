# Pricing Review — Honest Assessment for a Beginner

## The Honest Truth About Your Previous Prices

The previous version of this document pushed your prices to the **lowest competitive starting point within Reedsy's documented market range** — $500 for a standard cover, $1,200–$3,000 for branding, $1,800–$2,800 for children's books, and $1,800–$5,000 for pipeline packages.

**Those prices were too high for where you are right now.** Here's why:

1. **Zero client reviews** — You have never sold these services to a paying client. No testimonials, no ratings, no repeat customers.
2. **Portfolio proves self-work, not client work** — Your 22 published books and 3 series prove you can create great covers and branding for yourself. But clients want to see you've done it for _someone else_. That trust hasn't been earned yet.
3. **Reedsy rates are for established professionals** — The designers charging $500–$1,200 per cover on Reedsy have years of client work, 5-star review histories, and curated marketplace approval. You're not there yet.
4. **You work alone** — A solo operator just starting out shouldn't promise the scope of a full studio. The previous packages offered style guides, YouTube thumbnails, panoramic covers, author portraits, series bibles, and story writing — far too much for one person to deliver consistently while building a reputation.

**But your prices also shouldn't be rock-bottom.** You DO have:

- 22 published books with real covers across 3 distinct series
- A professional website that looks like a real business
- Live portfolio examples anyone can verify on Amazon
- Genuine experience with the KDP ecosystem

## What You Actually Do (Scope Clarification)

Before setting prices, the scope needs to be honest:

- **Front cover image only** — Kindle ebook and KDP Print paperback front cover. You do NOT design spines or back covers (you use Amazon Cover Creator for that).
- **Children's books** — 32 page illustrations + front and back cover images (no spine) + assembled PDF. You do NOT write stories — the client provides the story, you create the art.
- **Logos and box set covers** — Front cover images only. No spine, no back.
- **No style guide documents, no YouTube thumbnails, no panoramic covers, no author portraits, no series bibles, no story writing.**

This is what you should sell. Simple, honest, deliverable by one person in 1–2 days.

## Recommended Pricing — Competitive Beginner Rates

These prices are designed to:

- Sit above Fiverr bottom-feeders ($25–$75) who signal amateur quality
- Sit below established Reedsy professionals ($500–$1,200+) whose rates reflect years of client work
- Feel fair for someone with a real portfolio but no client history yet
- Be deliverable by one person in 1–2 days per package
- Leave room to raise prices as you build reviews and reputation

### Main Packages

| Package                                | Previous Price | New Price  | Rationale                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cover — Standard                       | $500           | **$150**   | Below Reedsy entry-level ($300), above Fiverr ($50). Fair for a beginner.  |
| Cover — Premium                        | $750           | **$250**   | Matches the low end of independent designers. 22-book portfolio justifies. |
| Branding — Starter (3 Books)           | $1,200         | **$400**   | 3 covers + logo + box set front. Good bundle value at ~$133/cover.         |
| Branding — Standard (5 Books)          | $2,000         | **$600**   | 5 covers + logo + box set front. ~$120/cover in bundle.                    |
| Branding — Premium (10 Books)          | $3,000         | **$950**   | 10 covers + logo + box set front. ~$95/cover. Great value, capped at 10.   |
| Children's — Standard (32 pages)       | $1,800         | **$500**   | 32 illustrations + front cover + PDF. ~$15/illustration is fair entry.     |
| Children's — Plus (32 pages, print)    | $2,200         | **$700**   | Adds back cover + print-ready formatting. Reasonable step up.              |
| Children's — Premium (32 pages + refs) | $2,800         | **$900**   | Adds character reference sheets. Top tier without overselling.             |
| Pipeline — Starter (3 Books)           | $1,800         | **$550**   | Covers + logo + box set + descriptions. $150 more than branding alone.     |
| Pipeline — Standard (5 Books)          | $2,800         | **$850**   | Full 5-book package with descriptions. Compelling bundle.                  |
| Pipeline — Premium (10 Books)          | $5,000         | **$1,350** | 10 covers + logo + box set + 10 descriptions. Your biggest package.        |

| Cover — Major Revision     | $200           | **$100**   | Real work but shouldn't cost as much as a new cover |
| Add New Book Cover         | $400           | **$125**   | Slightly below standard cover — loyal client perk   |
| Logo Refresh               | $250           | **$100**   | Reasonable for an update to existing work           |

## Why These Prices Work

### Not too cheap

- $150 for a single front cover is above Fiverr's typical $25–$100 range
- It signals "I take this seriously" without demanding established-pro trust
- Children's book at $500 for 32 illustrations is genuine value (~$15/illustration)

### Not too expensive

- Every price is below Reedsy's entry-level for comparable work
- A client with no reviews of you to check isn't going to pay $500+ for one cover
- Bundles offer clear savings over buying covers individually

### Deliverable by one person

- Every package can be completed in 1–3 days maximum
- No style guides, no series bibles, no story writing — just images and text
- Scope matches what you actually do, nothing more

### Room to grow

- As you accumulate 5–10 client reviews, raise covers to $200–$350
- As you hit 20+ reviews with 5-star ratings, move toward $350–$500
- Branding and pipeline bundles can scale proportionally
- The goal is to reach Reedsy-competitive rates ($500+) within 6–12 months of client work
