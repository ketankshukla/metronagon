## Section 1 — Your Existing Packages vs. Reedsy Market Rates

### Cover Design

| Package | Your Price | Reedsy Median | Reedsy Low End | Assessment |
|---------|-----------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| **Cover — Standard** | $99 | $930 | $300–$500 (novice range) | **Significantly underpriced** |
| **Cover — Premium** | $175 | $930 | $300–$500 (novice range) | **Significantly underpriced** |

**Reedsy's own data (2026):**
- Overall cover design median: **$930**
- 50% of all Reedsy cover collaborations: between **$630 and $1,200**
- Entry-level / novice designers: **$300–$500**
- Photo manipulation + typography approach: **$700–$800**
- Custom illustration / art-directed: **$900–$1,500+**

**By genre (Reedsy median per cover):**
| Genre | Reedsy Median |
|-------|--------------|
| Fantasy | $910 |
| Young Adult | $900 |
| Romance | $800 |
| Self-Help | $800 |
| Science Fiction | $850 |
| Historical Fiction | $750 |
| Literary Fiction | $750 |
| Middle Grade | $700–$1,080 |
| Thriller / Mystery | $700 |
| Nonfiction (General) | $700 |
| Biography / Memoir | $680 |

**Verdict:** Your cover prices ($99–$175) are below even the lowest documented entry-level range on Reedsy ($300–$500). If you list on Reedsy, you should quote a minimum of **$400–$500** for Standard and **$600–$800** for Premium to be taken seriously as a professional. At $99–$175, clients may question the quality before even seeing the work — low pricing in a premium marketplace signals inexperience, not value.

**Recommended Reedsy quotes (to net your current prices, adjusted to market):**
- Standard: Quote **$500–$700** (net $450–$630)
- Premium: Quote **$750–$950** (net $675–$855)

### Series Branding

| Package | Your Price | Reedsy Comparable | Assessment |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Branding — Starter (3 Books)** | $275 | $1,800–$3,000+ | **Severely underpriced** |
| **Branding — Standard (5 Books)** | $475 | $3,000–$5,000+ | **Severely underpriced** |
| **Branding — Premium (8+ Books)** | $750 | $5,000–$8,000+ | **Severely underpriced** |

**How to read these numbers:** Reedsy doesn't have a "series branding bundle" category. The comparable cost on Reedsy would be: N covers × per-cover median + logo design + style guide + box set cover. A professional series logo on its own typically runs $200–$500 from a designer. A style guide adds $150–$300. A box set or panoramic cover adds another cover-equivalent cost.

**3-book series branding built from Reedsy components:**
- 3 covers at $700 each = $2,100
- Series logo = $300
- Box set cover = $700
- Style guide = $200
- **Total comparable: ~$3,300**

**Your Starter price: $275.** You are delivering ~$3,300 worth of work for less than 10% of the Reedsy equivalent.

**5-book series branding built from Reedsy components:**
- 5 covers at $700 each = $3,500
- Series logo = $300
- Box set cover + YouTube thumbnail = $750
- Style guide = $200
- **Total comparable: ~$4,750**

**Your Standard price: $475.** Less than 10% of the Reedsy equivalent.

**Verdict:** Branding packages represent your biggest pricing gap. These bundles are genuinely valuable precisely because no single Reedsy freelancer delivers all components as a coordinated package. The bundled value should command a premium, not a discount below individual component prices.

**Recommended Reedsy quotes:**
- Branding Starter (3 Books): Quote **$1,200–$1,800** (position as an exceptional value vs. hiring separately)
- Branding Standard (5 Books): Quote **$2,000–$2,800**
- Branding Premium (8+ Books): Quote **$3,000–$4,500**

### Full Pipeline Packages

| Package | Your Price | Reedsy Comparable | Assessment |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Pipeline — Starter (3 Books)** | $425 | $3,500–$5,000+ | **Severely underpriced** |
| **Pipeline — Standard (5 Books)** | $650 | $5,000–$8,000+ | **Severely underpriced** |
| **Pipeline — Premium (8+ Books)** | $1,400 | $8,000–$15,000+ | **Underpriced** |

**Note on comparables:** Reedsy doesn't have a "full pipeline" category — no single freelancer on Reedsy offers planning + branding + covers + descriptions as a single package. A comparable scope on Reedsy would require hiring:
- A developmental editor (series architecture/planning): $1,000–$3,000+
- A cover designer (all books): $700–$930 × book count
- A marketing specialist (Amazon descriptions, metadata): $681 average per project
- A brand designer (logo, style guide): $500–$1,000+

**Pipeline Starter (3 books) comparable from Reedsy components:**
- Series planning (editor): ~$1,500
- 3 covers: ~$2,100
- Amazon descriptions: ~$500
- Branding: ~$800
- **Total comparable: ~$4,900**

**Your price: $425.**

**Pipeline Premium (8+ books) comparable from Reedsy components:**
- Series architecture (editor, large project): ~$3,000–$5,000
- 8+ covers: ~$5,600+
- Amazon descriptions (8 books): ~$1,500
- Full branding + panoramic + author portrait: ~$2,000+
- **Total comparable: ~$12,000–$14,000**

**Your price: $1,400.**

**Verdict:** The Pipeline packages are your most distinctive offering. Nothing like them exists as a single purchase on Reedsy. This uniqueness means you can command a higher price — not just because of the components, but because the integration value (everything coordinated and planned as a unified whole) eliminates the orchestration burden for the author. These deserve significant price increases, especially on Reedsy.

**Recommended Reedsy quotes:**
- Pipeline Starter (3 Books): Quote **$1,800–$2,500** (position as a complete package vs. the $5,000+ it would cost to assemble separately)
- Pipeline Standard (5 Books): Quote **$2,800–$3,800**
- Pipeline Premium (8+ Books): Quote **$5,000–$7,000**

### Children's Picture Books

| Package | Your Price | Reedsy Range | Assessment |
|---------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Children's — Standard (32 pages)** | $500 | $1,540–$4,950 | **Underpriced** |
| **Children's — Plus (32 pages, print-ready)** | $750 | $1,540–$4,950 | **Underpriced** |
| **Children's — Premium (32 pages + character design)** | $1,000 | $1,540–$4,950 | **Low end of range** |

**Reedsy's data:** Over the past three years, the average children's book illustrator on Reedsy has charged between **$1,540 and $4,950 for a 24-page picture book**. Your packages are for 32 pages — a longer book that would command the higher end of that range.

The $1,540 end of the Reedsy range represents minimal, simple illustration styles. The $4,950+ end is for detailed, professional-grade illustration with character consistency, rich backgrounds, and a full production pipeline — which is what your Premium package explicitly delivers.

**Verdict:** At $500–$750 for a complete 32-page picture book, you are delivering more pages than the typical Reedsy project at significantly below the minimum Reedsy market price. The Premium package at $1,000 sits at the very bottom of the Reedsy range for a 24-page book — and you deliver 32 pages. This is where you are most dramatically leaving money on the table.

**Recommended Reedsy quotes:**
- Children's Standard (32 pages): Quote **$1,800–$2,500**
- Children's Plus (32 pages, print-ready): Quote **$2,200–$3,000**
- Children's Premium (32 pages + character system): Quote **$2,800–$4,000**

These are services you don't currently offer as packages, compared to what Reedsy's market charges.

### Paperback / Hardcover Print Wrap

| Your Quote Range | Reedsy Comparable | Assessment |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| $150–$575 | $300–$600 | **Competitive** |

### Book Description / Amazon Blurb Writing

| Your Quote Range | Reedsy Comparable | Assessment |

| $150–$800 | $300–$700+ | **Slightly low to competitive** |

Reedsy categorizes this under "Metadata and blurb optimization" as part of their marketing services, with an average project cost of **$681**. Your per-description prices ($150 single, $600 full series) are in the right territory for single books but could be higher for series packages given the Reedsy benchmark.

**Recommended Reedsy quotes:**
- Single description: $200–$350
- Series descriptions (3 books): $500–$700
- Series descriptions (5 books): $750–$1,000

### Amazon Listing Optimization

| Your Quote Range | Reedsy Comparable | Assessment |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| $60–$650 | $500–$1,200+ | **Too low at the entry end** |

Reedsy's marketing specialists charge $500–$1,200+ for metadata strategy and optimization. Your $60 single-book keyword audit is far below market. The comprehensive 5-book package at $650 is at the low end of what Reedsy charges for a single-book optimization project.

**Recommended Reedsy quotes:**
- Single book full optimization: $400–$600
- Series optimization (3 books): $700–$900

---

|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| $85–$1,500 | $150–$500 per portrait | **Low to competitive** |

Individual character portraits on Reedsy typically run $150–$500 per character depending on detail. Your single portrait at $85 is below market. Your multi-character packages ($650–$1,500) are competitive for the volume.

|-----------------|-------------------|------------|

Your range is well within the competitive zone for this service, and your live examples (aztec.ketanshukla.com, repetition.ketanshukla.com, reality.ketanshukla.com) are among the best portfolio examples for this service on any platform.

---

## Section 3 — Overall Pricing Strategy Summary

### The Core Issue: Your Prices Are Built for Direct Sales, Not Premium Marketplaces

Your current pricing was built for a direct-to-client sales model where the low price is part of the value proposition. Reedsy is a different context: authors come to Reedsy expecting to pay professional rates, and low prices can actually reduce your conversion rate by signaling inexperience.

**The three categories of adjustment:**

#### 🔴 Raise Significantly (Underpriced by 5–10×)
- All cover design packages ($99–$175 → should be $400–$950)
- All branding packages ($275–$750 → should be $1,200–$4,500)
- All pipeline packages ($425–$1,400 → should be $1,800–$7,000)
- All children's book packages ($500–$1,000 → should be $1,800–$4,000)

#### 🟡 Raise Moderately (Underpriced by 1.5–3×)
- Amazon listing optimization ($60 single → $400+ on Reedsy)
- Interior formatting (Kindle edition $200 → $300–$400)
- Book description writing ($150 → $250–$350 on Reedsy)
- Audiobook cover ($75 adaptation → $250+ on Reedsy)
- Character portraits ($85 single → $200–$350)
- Author bio writing ($75 → $200+)
- Series naming ($100 → $200+)

#### 🟢 Keep As-Is or Minor Adjustment
- Print wrap pricing ($150–$575) — competitive
- Social media launch pack ($275–$1,000) — within range
- Author series website ($1,500–$3,500) — competitive
- Book trailer ($350–$950) — within range
- Series interior formatting bundles ($750–$1,100) — competitive

### The Bundling Advantage — Your Unique Position on Reedsy

The most important insight from this comparison is not the individual price gaps — it's the bundle gap. **No single freelancer on Reedsy offers what your pipeline and branding packages offer as a unified service.** An author would need to hire 3–5 separate professionals, coordinate them independently, and pay $5,000–$15,000+ to get the same result.

Your pitch on Reedsy should lead with this. The price is not the story — the integration is the story. "One professional, one project, every component coordinated from the start" is a genuine market differentiator that justifies pricing at the upper-middle of the Reedsy range even after significant increases.
