## 1. What Reedsy Is and How It Works

Reedsy is a curated marketplace that connects authors with publishing professionals. Unlike Fiverr or Upwork, Reedsy hand-vets every professional — which means once you're approved, you carry instant credibility. Authors on Reedsy are typically serious, mid-career to established writers with real budgets. They're not looking for the cheapest option; they're looking for the best fit.

### How the platform works

1. **You apply** and submit a portfolio for approval. Reedsy reviews your work quality before letting you list services.
2. **Authors post project briefs** describing what they need (e.g., "I need a cover for a 5-book fantasy series").
3. **You receive the brief** and can submit a proposal — a short pitch plus a custom quote.
4. **The author chooses** a professional from the proposals they receive.
5. **Work happens** through Reedsy's platform (messaging, milestones, file delivery).
6. **Payment is processed** by Reedsy, who takes **20%** of every invoice.
7. **Both parties leave reviews** after project completion.

### What this means for you

- Factor the 20% Reedsy fee into every quote (covered in Section 10)
- Your portfolio images are the single most important element of your profile
- Response speed to briefs matters — authors tend to pick from the first few proposals
- Reviews are everything. Your first 3–5 reviews will define your trajectory on the platform

### Relevant categories for Metronagon

| Reedsy Category | Your Relevant Services |
|----------------|----------------------|
| **Book Cover Designer** | All cover packages, series branding |
| **Illustrator** | Children's picture book packages |

Apply separately for each category if Reedsy allows it, or list both in your profile.

---

## 2. How to Apply and Get Approved

### Step-by-step application

1. Go to [reedsy.com](https://reedsy.com) and click **"Apply as a professional"**
2. Select your primary category: **Book Cover Designer**
3. Fill in your name, email, and create your account
4. Complete your profile fully before submitting for review

### What Reedsy looks for during approval

- **Portfolio quality:** Your images need to look commercially publishable. Show covers that could genuinely sit on Amazon today.
- **Professional presentation:** Your bio must be polished, specific, and confident.
- **Breadth of genre experience:** Showing covers across multiple genres signals you can handle diverse briefs.
- **Proven track record:** 22 published books across 3 complete series is a massive credibility signal. Lead with this.

### Approval tips

- Do not apply before your portfolio images are ready. First impressions to the approval team are the same as first impressions to authors.
- Write your bio in full before submitting — a sparse bio can result in rejection.
- If you are rejected initially, you can reapply. But it is far better to go in fully prepared.

---

## 3. Profile Photo — The First Impression

Your profile photo appears next to every proposal you send and on your public profile. Authors will see it before they read a single word you write.

### Requirements

- **Professional headshot** — not a logo, not a book cover, not a graphic. A real, clean photo of your face.
- **Good lighting** — natural light or a ring light. No dark, grainy, or harsh flash photos.
- **Neutral or simple background** — white, grey, or softly blurred environment. No clutter.
- **Dress professionally** — smart casual at minimum.
- **Square crop** — your face should fill most of the frame. Reedsy displays photos at small size; a distant shot loses all personality.
- **Approachable expression** — authors need to trust you with their book.

### What to avoid

- Overly staged glamour shots
- Logos or text layered over the photo
- Sunglasses or group photos

---

## 4. Your Professional Tagline

The tagline appears beneath your name in search results. Authors read this first.

### Recommended tagline options (pick one)

**Option A — Credential-forward:**
> Book Cover Designer & Illustrator — 22 Published Books, 3 Complete Series

**Option B — Outcome-forward:**
> Professional Book Cover Design & Series Branding That Sells

**Option C — Most concise and punchy:**
> Series Cover Design & Branding — Built from 22 Published Books

**Recommendation:** Use **Option A** or **Option C**. The "22 Published Books, 3 Complete Series" credential is genuinely rare and sets you apart from every generic designer on the platform. Authors immediately understand you've done this for real — not just for clients, but for yourself. That is a completely different level of credibility.

---

## 5. Your Bio — Full Written Example

Your bio is the most important block of text on your profile. Authors read it carefully before deciding whether to send a brief.

### Rules for a great Reedsy bio

- **Write in first person** — "I designed..." not "Ketan designs..."
- **Lead with credentials, not backstory** — numbers and specific project names beat vague adjectives like "passionate"
- **Address the author's problem** — they need a cover that sells and a series that looks unified
- **End with a clear call to action** — tell them what to do next
- **Length:** 200–350 words — long enough to be credible, short enough to be read in full

---

### Recommended Bio (ready to use or adapt)

> I'm Ketan Shukla, the founder of Metronagon Media and a published author with 22 books across three complete series. That distinction matters: I don't just design covers for authors — I've been through the entire publishing process myself, from writing and world-building to cover design, series branding, and launch. The pipeline I use for my clients is the exact same one I built and refined on my own published work.
>
> My specialties are book cover design, series visual identity, and children's book illustration.
>
> On the cover design side, I've created dozens of professional covers spanning fantasy fiction, non-fiction self-improvement, and philosophical essays — including a complete 12-book fantasy series (Aztec Samurai Adventures) with consistent branding across every volume, custom series logo, box set covers, and character portraits. I understand what makes a cover work at thumbnail size on Amazon, how to signal genre at a glance, and how to build visual systems that scale when your series grows.
>
> For authors building a series, I offer complete branding packages: series logo, style guide, box set cover, and all individual book covers — designed together as a unified system from day one, not retrofitted later when things stop matching.
>
> For children's book authors, I produce complete 32-page illustrated picture books with consistent character design on every page — one of the most technically demanding aspects of illustrated book production. I handle story writing or adaptation, all illustrations, and deliver a fully assembled, print-ready PDF.
>
> I work fast without sacrificing quality. Most single cover projects are delivered within 2–3 business days. Series packages within a week.
>
> If you have a book that needs a cover that works — or a series that needs a visual identity that holds together — I'd like to hear about it. Send me a brief and I'll respond within 24 hours.

---

### Why this bio works

- **Opens with unique credibility** — no other designer on Reedsy will have 22 published books across 3 series
- **"I've been through the entire publishing process myself"** — powerful for authors who want someone who genuinely understands their world
- **Specific project names** (Aztec Samurai Adventures, 12-book series) — concrete proof, not vague claims
- **Addresses series authors specifically** — the highest-value, highest-budget segment of the market
- **Covers children's books explicitly** — opens a second market segment
- **Turnaround times** — authors love knowing they won't wait weeks
- **Ends with an invitation** — creates forward momentum

---

## 7. Portfolio Strategy — What to Upload and How

Your portfolio is the make-or-break element of your profile. Before an author reads your bio, they will look at your portfolio images. This is where projects are won or lost.

### How many images

Reedsy typically allows 6–12 portfolio pieces. Quality beats quantity. Choose your 8–10 strongest.

### What to upload and in what order

**Position 1 — Series composite: Aztec Samurai Adventures**

Create a single image showing 3–4 covers from the series arranged side by side, with the series logo visible. This is your opener. Bold, colorful, and immediately demonstrates you can handle epic-scale series work. Composites showing multiple covers in one image communicate series consistency far more powerfully than individual shots.

**Position 2 — Series composite: Repetition Series**

Same approach — 3–4 covers side by side. This shows you can work in completely different genre aesthetics (non-fiction vs. fantasy).

**Position 3 — Series composite: Reality Without Belief**

3–4 covers arranged together. This demonstrates a third, entirely different aesthetic — philosophical/minimal. By now, anyone reviewing your portfolio has seen you operate confidently across three distinct visual worlds. That is a rare and credible signal.

**Position 4 — Individual standout cover**

Pick your single most visually striking individual cover. This should be something that would stop a scroll on Amazon — maximum visual impact, genre-accurate, professional typography.

**Position 5 — Children's book composite**

Create a single image showing: the front cover of Ixchel, 2–3 interior page spreads, and a small grid of multiple pages to demonstrate character consistency. This tells the complete story of the project and opens the children's book market segment.

**Position 6 — Series logo / branding mockup**

Create a mockup showing a series logo alongside its covers — ideally the Aztec Samurai logo with 2–3 covers. This positions you clearly as a branding designer, not just a cover-maker — a premium service tier that many authors don't know they need until they see it.

### How to create composite images

Use any image editor (Photoshop, Canva):
- 2400×1600px canvas (landscape)
- 3–4 covers side by side with small gaps between them
- Simple text label at bottom: e.g., "Aztec Samurai Adventures — 12-Book Fantasy Series"
- Export as high-quality JPG

### Portfolio titles and descriptions

Reedsy lets you add a title and description to each piece. Use this space:

**Aztec Samurai Adventures:**
> **Title:** 12-Book Fantasy Series — Complete Visual Identity
> **Description:** Full branding package for a 12-book fantasy fiction series. Deliverables included 12 individual ebook covers (1600×2400, 300 DPI), custom series logo, 2 box set covers, landscape panoramic, and 8 character portraits — all unified under a single style guide. Every cover shares consistent color grading, typography, lighting direction, and compositional language.

**Repetition Series:**
> **Title:** 5-Book Non-Fiction Series — Brand Identity
> **Description:** Complete brand identity for a self-improvement series. Five cohesive ebook covers with a unified typographic and color system, custom series logo, landscape box set cover, and YouTube thumbnail. Designed to project authority and professionalism at first glance.

**Reality Without Belief:**
> **Title:** 5-Book Essay Series — Minimalist Aesthetic
> **Description:** A philosophical essay series requiring a completely different aesthetic — contemplative, minimal, intellectual. Restrained color palettes, quiet depth, understated logo. Demonstrates the pipeline's versatility: the same production system that created bold fantasy covers also produced refined minimal philosophical design.

**Children's Book:**
> **Title:** 32-Page Children's Picture Book — Ixchel and the Stolen Sun
> **Description:** Complete illustrated picture book with full-color illustrations on every page. The main character maintains consistent appearance, proportions, and clothing across all 32 pages. Includes story development, all illustrations, and fully assembled print-ready PDF. Pixar/Disney-inspired art style.

## 9. How to Respond to Client Briefs

When an author submits a brief, Reedsy notifies matching professionals who can then submit a proposal. You have roughly 24–48 hours before the author starts making decisions — respond fast.

### What makes a proposal win

- **It's personalized** — the author can tell you read their specific brief
- **It demonstrates instant relevant expertise** — drop a specific example matching their genre or project type
- **It builds confidence** — mention something only an experienced designer would know
- **It's not too long** — 150–250 words. Authors read dozens of proposals. Be clear, brief, compelling.
- **It ends with next steps** — don't leave them wondering what happens

### Proposal template — Cover design brief

*(Customize the bracketed sections for each specific brief)*

> Hi [Author Name],
>
> I've designed covers across fantasy, non-fiction, and children's genres — including a complete 12-book fantasy series where every cover shares the same style guide, series logo, and visual language. So when I read your brief for [their project], I immediately had a clear direction in mind.
>
> What I'd bring to your project: [1 specific observation about their brief — genre, mood, comp titles they mentioned, tone of the story description]. That's the angle I'd explore in the initial concepts.
>
> My process: You receive 3 concept variations — fully developed, not rough sketches. You pick the strongest direction, I refine it to final polish with [X] round(s) of revisions. Delivered in [X] business days at 1600×2400, 300 DPI, Amazon KDP-ready.
>
> You can see relevant work at metronagon.com or on my Reedsy portfolio.
>
> Happy to answer any questions. If you'd like to move forward, I'm ready to start immediately.
>
> — Ketan Shukla, Metronagon Media

---

### Proposal template — Children's book brief

> Hi [Author Name],
>
> Character consistency across 32 pages is the single hardest problem in illustrated picture books — and it's exactly what I've solved in my own published children's book, Ixchel and the Stolen Sun, which I produced from story to print-ready PDF. The same system is available to you.
>
> For your project, I'd start with a character design reference sheet — front view, expressions, clothing — before a single page gets illustrated. This is what keeps your main character looking like the same person from page 1 to page 32.
>
> [One specific observation about their brief — the character type, the story theme, the style they described.]
>
> My process: Story adaptation (or original writing if needed), character design system, full-color illustrations on every page, assembled PDF, individual image files. Delivered in [X] business days with [X] round(s) of revisions.
>
> You can see the full Ixchel book and other work at metronagon.com.
>
> Let me know if you have questions — I respond same day.
>
> — Ketan Shukla, Metronagon Media

---

### The most important rule for proposals

**Never send the same proposal to every brief.** Reedsy authors can tell immediately when something is copy-pasted. Even one or two specific sentences about their actual book — their genre, a plot detail they mentioned, a comp title — makes the difference between a proposal that gets read and one that gets dismissed.

---

## 10. Pricing Strategy — Accounting for Reedsy's Cut

Reedsy takes **20% of every invoice**. To protect your income, adjust prices so that after the 20% cut, you net the same amount you charge on Metronagon directly.

### The math

To net $X after Reedsy's 20% cut, quote $X ÷ 0.80.

| Metronagon Price (what you want to net) | Reedsy Quote |
|----------------------------------------|--------------|
| $99 | $124 → round to **$125** |
| $175 | $219 → round to **$220** |
| $275 | $344 → round to **$345** |
| $475 | $594 → round to **$595** |
| $500 | $625 → **$625** |
| $750 | $938 → round to **$940** |
| $800 | $1,000 → **$1,000** |
| $1,000 | $1,250 → **$1,250** |
| $1,400 | $1,750 → **$1,750** |

### Reedsy pricing context

These prices are well within the normal range for Reedsy professionals. Top cover designers on Reedsy regularly charge $300–$800 for a single cover. Your $125–$220 range for a single cover is competitive, which helps win early projects. As your reviews accumulate, raise prices.

### When to use custom quotes

For Full Pipeline packages (series planning + cover design + branding + book descriptions), use Reedsy's custom quote feature rather than fixed package pricing. Send a proposal, then issue a detailed custom quote after discussing scope. These are premium projects worth a tailored conversation.

---

## 11. Getting Your First Reviews

On Reedsy, reviews are your currency. Without reviews, you're invisible to most authors who sort by rating. Getting your first 3–5 reviews as quickly as possible is your primary goal when starting.

### Strategy 1 — Price competitively early

For your first 2–3 Reedsy projects, quote at the lower end of your range. A $125 cover that earns a glowing review is worth more long-term than a $220 cover that goes unreviewed. You're investing in platform credibility.

### Strategy 2 — Over-deliver on the first project

- Give 4 concept variations instead of 3
- Deliver a day early
- Include a bonus file (e.g., a thumbnail-cropped version for Amazon's browse image, or a 1:1 social media version)
- Follow up after delivery asking if they need any final tweaks

When clients feel they got more than expected, they leave enthusiastic reviews unprompted.

### Strategy 3 — Ask for the review at the right moment

The best time to ask is immediately after the client expresses satisfaction — not after final delivery when the project is closing. When they message you saying "This is exactly what I wanted," reply:

> "I'm really glad it hit the mark. Once we've closed the project, I'd really appreciate a review — it helps other authors find me and know what to expect. No pressure at all, but if you have a moment it means a lot."

### Strategy 4 — Let your portfolio carry you while reviews build

While building Reedsy reviews, your portfolio images do the heavy lifting. Every cover from your 3 published series is proof. Direct authors to metronagon.com for the full picture. Reviews will come — and once you have 5+, your profile becomes self-sustaining.

---

## 12. Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1 — Vague bio with no credentials**
> "I am a passionate designer with years of experience creating beautiful book covers." — This says nothing. Reedsy has hundreds of designers who write exactly this. Lead with specifics: 22 books, 3 complete series, named projects.

**Mistake 2 — Uploading individual covers instead of series composites**
> Individual covers look like a scattered portfolio. Composites of 3–4 covers in one image immediately communicate: *this designer builds series, not just single books.* That is your competitive advantage — show it visually.

**Mistake 3 — Ignoring briefs or responding too slowly**
> Reedsy authors typically review proposals within 24–48 hours of posting. If you respond on day 3, you are almost certainly too late. Check your Reedsy notifications daily and respond to every relevant brief within a few hours.

**Mistake 4 — Copy-pasting proposals**
> Authors on Reedsy are writers. They can spot a generic proposal instantly. One personalized sentence about their specific book is worth more than three paragraphs of polished boilerplate.

**Mistake 5 — Underpricing without accounting for the 20% cut**
> If you quote your Metronagon price directly on Reedsy, you net 80% of what you intended. Always apply the ÷ 0.80 formula before quoting.

**Mistake 6 — Not listing your portfolio websites**
> metronagon.com and your author portfolio at ketanshukla.com are live proof of your work. Mention them in your bio and in proposals. Authors who click through and see 22 books and 3 complete series will be much more confident than those who only see your Reedsy portfolio.

**Mistake 7 — Treating Reedsy as set-and-forget**
> A static profile decays. Authors want to see recent reviews and current availability. Log in regularly, update your availability status, and add new portfolio images as you complete notable work.

**Mistake 8 — Not offering children's book services**
> The children's book market on Reedsy is underserved. Most designers either don't do illustration or don't do it well. Your completed 32-page picture book is a differentiator. Make sure this service is clearly listed — many authors looking for illustration are specifically on Reedsy because Fiverr illustrators have let them down.

---

## 13. Long-Term Profile Optimization

### After your first 5 reviews

- Raise your package prices by 10–15%. Your reviews are now doing the selling.
- Apply for the **Reedsy Discovery** program if available — it gives additional visibility to your profile.
- Begin declining briefs that are too far below your target price. Early-stage discounting is a strategy, not a permanent state.

### Adding new portfolio pieces

Every time you complete a notable client project on Reedsy, add the best image to your portfolio (with client permission). A portfolio that grows over time signals an active, in-demand professional.

### Responding to every brief, even ones you'll decline

When you receive a brief that isn't a good fit, send a brief, professional response:

> "Thank you for your brief — this project isn't quite in my current availability window, but I wanted to respond rather than ignore your request. Best of luck finding the right designer."

This costs nothing and maintains your response rate metric, which Reedsy tracks and displays on your profile.

### Reedsy's internal search ranking factors

Reedsy ranks professionals in search results based on:
- **Response rate** — respond to every brief, even to decline
- **Review score** — protect your average; under-promise and over-deliver
- **Profile completeness** — fill in every section Reedsy offers
- **Activity** — log in regularly; inactive profiles rank lower
- **Project volume** — completing more projects increases visibility

### Cross-promotion

- Reference your Reedsy profile in the footer of emails you send to any author you interact with
- Add a "Find me on Reedsy" link to your metronagon.com website (a small trust badge in the footer works well)
- As you gain Reedsy reviews, screenshot the best ones and add them to your testimonials page at metronagon.com
