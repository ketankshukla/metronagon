---

## Phase 1: Initial Inquiry

### Scenario A: Client Wants the Best Quality

**CLIENT:**
> Hi, I'm creating a children's picture book and I want the absolute best quality. What's your top-tier package?

**YOU:**
> Hi! My Premium package ($900) is the highest-quality children's picture book option I offer. Here's what sets it apart:
>
> - **Character reference sheets** — Before I illustrate a single page, I create dedicated reference sheets for your characters: front view, expressions, and clothing defined. This is the key to flawless consistency across all 32 pages.
> - **32 fully illustrated pages** with multiple refinement passes — premium quality means each page gets extra attention to detail, lighting, and expression
> - **Front AND back cover illustrations**
> - **Print-ready PDF** formatted to KDP Print specifications
> - **All page illustrations** as individual high-res files
> - **2 rounds of revisions**
> - **3 business day delivery**
>
> The character reference sheets are the biggest differentiator. In Standard and Plus, I use style anchoring to maintain consistency. In Premium, I create actual reference documents first — you approve the characters before any pages are illustrated. This means zero surprises and maximum consistency.
>
> Would you like to move forward?

---

### Scenario B: Client Comparing Plus vs Premium

**CLIENT:**
> I'm torn between Plus ($700) and Premium ($900). Is the Premium worth the extra $200?

**YOU:**
> Here's the honest comparison:
>
> | Feature | Plus ($700) | Premium ($900) |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | 32 illustrated pages | Enhanced quality | **Premium quality (extra refinement passes)** |
> | Character reference sheets | No (style anchoring used) | **Yes — dedicated sheets before production** |
> | Front + back cover | Yes | Yes |
> | Print-ready PDF | Yes | Yes |
> | Individual page files | Yes | Yes |
> | Revision rounds | 2 | 2 |
> | Delivery | 2 days | 3 days |
>
> **The $200 difference buys you:**
> 1. **Character reference sheets** — You see and approve exactly how your characters look before I illustrate any pages. If something's off (hair wrong, expression too old, clothing not right), we fix it at the reference stage — not after 32 pages are done.
> 2. **Higher illustration quality** — Multiple refinement passes per page. Richer backgrounds, more detailed character expressions, more polished lighting.
>
> **My recommendation:**
> - If your book has complex or distinctive characters (specific ethnicity, detailed costumes, fantasy creatures), go Premium. The reference sheets prevent costly corrections.
> - If characters are simple and you're confident in describing them, Plus delivers a beautiful book.
>
> Which describes your situation?

---

### Scenario C: Client Asks About the Reference Sheet Process

**CLIENT:**
> Can you explain more about the character reference sheets? How does that work?

**YOU:**
> The character reference sheet is a dedicated design document created before any page illustrations begin. Here's the process:
>
> 1. **You describe your characters** in the creative brief (appearance, age, clothing, personality)
> 2. **I create a reference sheet** for each main character showing:
>    - Front-facing view (full body)
>    - 2-3 facial expressions (happy, sad, surprised, etc.)
>    - Clothing details
>    - Color palette for the character
>    - Size comparison if there are multiple characters
> 3. **You review and approve** the reference sheets (or request changes)
> 4. **Once approved**, I use these sheets as the locked reference for all 32 pages
>
> This means:
> - You know exactly how your characters will look before committing to 32 pages
> - Character consistency is essentially guaranteed — every page references the approved sheet
> - Any changes to character design happen at the sheet stage, not after the book is illustrated
>
> It adds about 1 day to the process (3-day delivery vs 2-day) but the result is significantly more polished and consistent.

---

## Phase 2: Creative Brief Request

**YOU:**

## Phase 3: Character Reference Sheet Delivery

This is a Premium-exclusive step that happens BEFORE page illustration.

**YOU:**
> Hi [Client]! Before I start illustrating pages, here are your character reference sheets for approval.
>
> **[Main Character Name] — Reference Sheet**
> [Image attached]
> - Front view (full body): [Description of how the character looks]
> - Expressions: Happy, sad, surprised, determined
> - Clothing detail: [Description matching brief]
> - Color palette: [Swatches for skin, hair, clothing, accessories]
>
> **[Supporting Character Name] — Reference Sheet**
> [Image attached]
> - [Same structure as above]
>
> **Size Comparison**
> [Image attached]
> All characters shown side by side to establish relative heights and proportions.
>
> **What to do next:**
> 1. Review each character carefully — Does this match your vision?
> 2. Tell me what to change — hair, eyes, clothing, proportions, expressions, anything
> 3. Once you approve, I'll use these sheets as the locked reference for all 32 pages
>
> **This is NOT a revision round** — reference sheet approval is a separate step included in the Premium package. Your 2 revision rounds apply to the page illustrations after these sheets are approved.
>
> Take your time. Getting the characters right here means getting every page right.

### Scenario A: Client Approves Reference Sheets

**CLIENT:**
> These are perfect! Exactly how I imagined them. Go ahead!

**YOU:**
> Excellent! Character references are now locked. I'll use these as the foundation for all 32 pages.
>
> Page illustrations + front cover + back cover + print-ready PDF will be ready within 2 business days from now.
>
> Starting production!

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants Reference Sheet Changes

**CLIENT:**
> Almost perfect! But:
> - Main character's nose should be smaller
> - The hair should be curlier
> - Can the clothing be a brighter shade of blue?

**YOU:**
> Easy fixes — I'll adjust:
> 1. Smaller nose on [character name]
> 2. Curlier hair texture
> 3. Brighter blue clothing
>
> I'll send updated reference sheets within a few hours. Once you approve, I'll lock these and begin page production.

---

### Scenario C: Client Wants a Fundamentally Different Look

**CLIENT:**
> This isn't what I envisioned at all. I was thinking a completely different style — more like watercolor, softer features, less 3D.

**YOU:**
> I appreciate the honesty — this is exactly why we do reference sheets before pages. Better to redirect now than after 32 pages.
>
> I'll create new reference sheets in a watercolor/soft style. Can you:
> 1. Send me 2-3 reference images that show the style you're envisioning?
> 2. Tell me specifically what "softer features" means — rounder face? Simpler eyes? Less defined lines?
>
> I'll create new sheets in the adjusted style. This is still part of the reference sheet stage — your 2 revision rounds for pages remain untouched.

---

## Phase 4: Full Illustration Delivery

**YOU:**
> Hi [Client]! All 32 pages, covers, and the print-ready PDF are complete.
>
> **Front Cover**
> [Image attached]
> [Description — tied to the approved character reference sheets, showing the locked character design]
>
> **Back Cover**
> [Image attached]
> [Description — tagline, small illustration, barcode area]
>
> **Character Consistency Check:**
> Every page uses the approved reference sheets. [Main character] appears on [X] pages — same face, proportions, clothing, and accessories throughout.
>
> **Sample Pages:**
> [4-5 representative pages shown with descriptions]
>
> **Complete Delivery:**
> - Print-ready PDF (with proper bleed, margins, gutter)
> - Front cover PNG/JPG
> - Back cover PNG/JPG
> - All 32 page illustrations as individual PNGs
> - Character reference sheets (for your records — useful if you do a sequel)
>
> **What to do next:**
> 1. Review all pages for character consistency, text readability, and emotional flow
> 2. Compare characters against the approved reference sheets — they should match perfectly
> 3. List ALL changes in one message — Revision Round 1 of 2
>
> Take your time!

---

## Phase 5: Revision Round 1

### Scenario A: Minor Adjustments

**CLIENT:**
> These are incredible! Just a few small things:
> - Page 8: Character's expression should be more worried, not just neutral
> - Page 15: Background feels empty — can you add some detail?
> - Page 28: Text overlapping with character's head — move text down
> - Cover: Can the title font have a slight shadow for readability?

**YOU:**
> All very doable:
> 1. Page 8 — Worried expression: furrowed brows, slight lip bite
> 2. Page 15 — Add background detail: [appropriate elements for the scene]
> 3. Page 28 — Shift text position downward to clear the character
> 4. Cover — Add subtle drop shadow on title for contrast/readability
>
> Revision Round 1 of 2. I'll deliver all updates together.

---

### Scenario B: Print Quality Concerns

**CLIENT:**
> When I zoom in on some pages, the details look slightly soft. Will this be sharp enough for print?

**YOU:**
> Good question. All illustrations are created at high resolution for print quality (300 DPI at your trim size). When you zoom in on screen at 200-400%, you may see some softness — that's normal and won't be visible in the printed book.
>
> However, I'll do a sharpness pass on all 32 pages to make sure everything is optimized for print output. If there are specific pages that concern you, point them out and I'll give those extra attention.
>
> This is part of Revision Round 1.

---

## Phase 6: Revision Round 2

### Scenario A: Final Polish

**CLIENT:**
> Round 1 looks great. One last thing — can the dedication page illustration be a bit more detailed? And page 30's lighting feels different from the rest of the book.

**YOU:**
> I'll handle both:
> 1. Dedication page — Enhanced illustration with more detail
> 2. Page 30 — Adjust lighting to match the established palette from surrounding pages
>
> This is Round 2 of 2 (your final included round). I'll apply these fixes plus a final print-readiness check across all pages before preparing delivery.

---

### Scenario B: Client Happy After Round 1

**CLIENT:**
> Round 1 is perfect. Let's finalize!

**YOU:**
> I'll do a final polish pass — sharpening, color consistency check, margin verification for print — and prepare your final delivery files. Round 2 remains available if you spot anything after receiving finals.

---

## Phase 7: Final Delivery

**YOU:**
> Hi [Client]! Your Premium picture book is finalized and print-ready.
>
> **Final Delivery — "[Book Title]"**
>
> **Print-Ready PDF:**
> - `[Book-Title]-PRINT-READY.pdf` — [Trim size], full bleed, margins, gutter. Ready for KDP Print upload.
>
> **Covers:**
> - `[Book-Title]-Front-Cover.png / .jpg`
> - `[Book-Title]-Back-Cover.png / .jpg`
>
> **Individual Page Files:**
> - `Page-01.png` through `Page-32.png`
>
> **Character Reference Sheets (for your records):**
> - `[Character-Name]-Reference-Sheet.png` (for each character)
>
> **Files delivered via:** Google Drive link (organized: /PrintPDF, /Covers, /Pages, /CharacterSheets)
>
> **Important — keep the character reference sheets!** If you ever do a sequel, I'll use these exact sheets to maintain perfect character consistency between books. Even if you work with a different illustrator someday, these sheets communicate exactly how your characters should look.
>
> **How to publish on KDP Print:**
> 1. Go to KDP → Create Paperback (or Hardcover)
> 2. Upload the print-ready PDF as your interior file
> 3. Use Amazon's Cover Creator for the full wrap (upload front + back covers)
> 4. Preview carefully in KDP's online previewer
> 5. Order a proof copy before going live — always check a physical copy
>
> Thank you for choosing the Premium package — the result speaks for itself. A Reedsy review would be incredible, and returning clients always get 10% off!

## Phase 8: Post-Delivery Scenarios

### Scenario A: Client Wants a Sequel

**CLIENT:**
> The book is selling great! We're doing a sequel. Same characters, new story.

**YOU:**
> Amazing! Since we have the character reference sheets from Book 1, the sequel will have perfect character continuity from page 1. Same faces, same proportions, same clothing — readers will recognize their favorite characters instantly.
>
> Same Premium package at $900. Returning client discount: **$810** (10% off).
>
> I'll create new reference sheets only for any NEW characters. Existing characters use the approved sheets from Book 1.
>
> Send me the new story text and brief whenever you're ready!

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants to Add a Character to the Existing Book

**CLIENT:**
> My editor suggested adding a new supporting character to a few pages. Can you do that?

**YOU:**
> Yes! For the Premium package, I'll:
> 1. Create a reference sheet for the new character ($75 — Children's Book New Character)
> 2. Add the character to the relevant pages ($35/page — Children's Book Page Edit)
>
> So if the new character appears on 4 pages: $75 + (4 x $35) = $215.
>
> Send me the character description and which pages they should appear on, and I'll get started.

---

### Scenario C: Client Wants to Use Reference Sheets for Merchandise

**CLIENT:**
> I want to use the character designs for merchandise — t-shirts, stickers, etc. Is that okay?

**YOU:**
> The character reference sheets and all illustrations are yours to use however you like — full commercial rights. You can use them for:
> - Merchandise (t-shirts, stickers, mugs, etc.)
> - Marketing materials
> - Social media
> - Website
> - Adaptations
>
> No additional licensing fees. Everything I create for you is yours.
