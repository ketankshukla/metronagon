---

## Phase 1: Initial Inquiry

### Scenario A: Client Inquires About Series Covers

**CLIENT:**
> Hi, I'm writing a 3-book fantasy series and I need covers for all of them. Do you do series work?

**YOU:**
> Hi! Absolutely — series branding is one of my core services. I've designed covers for three complete series on Amazon (22 books total), so I know exactly how to build visual consistency across multiple books.
>
> My Series Branding — Starter package is $400 for 3 books and includes:
> - 3 visually consistent front covers (Kindle + paperback ready)
> - Series logo (logomark + wordmark)
> - Box set front cover (for your Amazon box set listing)
> - 1 round of revisions on any deliverable
> - 2 business day delivery
>
> All covers share a unified color palette, typography system, and composition style — so they look like they belong together on Amazon, both individually and as a set.
>
> Would you like to move forward? I can send you the creative brief to get started.

---

### Scenario B: Client Asks Why Not Just Buy 3 Individual Covers

**CLIENT:**
> Couldn't I just buy 3 individual Standard covers? That would be $450 — only $50 more and I'd get 6 concepts instead of 3.

**YOU:**
> Good math! The difference isn't about concept count — it's about **consistency and extras.**
>
> With 3 individual covers, each one is designed independently. They might end up looking great individually but not cohesive as a series. Readers browse Amazon by thumbnail — if your 3 books don't instantly read as a set, you lose the "binge reader" effect.
>
> With the Series Branding package ($400):
> - All 3 covers are designed as a **unified system** from day one — same palette, same typography hierarchy, same composition logic
> - You get a **series logo** — a logomark and wordmark that anchors the whole series identity
> - You get a **box set front cover** — a separate image for your Amazon box set listing
> - The visual consistency drives binge reads — readers see Book 1, recognize Books 2 and 3 instantly
>
> You're saving $50 AND getting the logo + box set cover included. The branding package is the right move for a series.

---

### Scenario C: Client Has One Cover Already, Needs 2 More + Branding

**CLIENT:**
> I already have a cover for Book 1 that I like. Can you design Books 2 and 3 to match, plus give me a logo and box set cover?

**YOU:**
> Yes — I can work from your existing Book 1 cover as the style anchor. I'll match the palette, typography, and composition logic so Books 2 and 3 feel like they belong in the same series.
>
> Two options:
>
> **Option 1: Series Branding Starter ($400)** — I treat your existing Book 1 as the design reference and create 2 new matching covers + series logo + box set cover. Full package, unified result.
>
> **Option 2: 2x Add New Book Cover ($125 each = $250) + Logo ($100) + Box Set ($100) = $450** — A la carte pricing for the same deliverables, but $50 more.
>
> The branding package at $400 is the better deal. I'll use your Book 1 cover as the foundation and build the system around it.
>
> Want to proceed? Send me your Book 1 cover and I'll send the creative brief.

---

## Phase 2: Creative Brief Request

**YOU:**
> Here's the creative brief for your 3-book series. This is the most important document in the process — the more detail you provide, the stronger and more cohesive your series will look.
>
> **CREATIVE BRIEF — Series Branding (3 Books)**
>
> **1. Series Overview**
> - Series name (if you have one):
> - Genre:
> - Brief series description (3-4 sentences about the overall story arc):
> - Target audience — Who is your ideal reader?
>
> **2. Individual Book Details**
>
> *Book 1:*
> - Title (and subtitle, if any):
> - Brief description (2-3 sentences — what happens in this book?):
> - Key visual element or scene — What should this cover convey?
>
> *Book 2:*
> - Title (and subtitle, if any):
> - Brief description (2-3 sentences):
> - Key visual element or scene:
>
> *Book 3:*
> - Title (and subtitle, if any):
> - Brief description (2-3 sentences):
> - Key visual element or scene:
>
> **3. Visual Direction (for the whole series)**
> - Mood/tone — What feeling should the series evoke?
> - Color palette preferences — Colors you love or want to avoid:
> - Style preference — Photorealistic or stylized?
> - Key recurring visual element — Object, symbol, or motif tying the series together:
>
> **4. Reference Covers**
> - 3-5 existing book covers or series you admire — especially series with consistent branding (Amazon links or screenshots):
>
> **5. Logo and Typography**
> - Series logo direction — Any ideas, or "your call"?
> - Author name (exactly as it should appear on all covers):
> - Font style preference — Serif, sans-serif, script, display? Or "your call":
>
> **6. Publishing Platform**
> - Where will this be published? (Amazon Kindle, KDP Print Paperback, or KDP Print Hardcover?):
>
> Take your time. Once I have this, I'll design all 3 covers, the logo, and the box set cover as one unified system.

## Phase 3: Receiving the Brief

### Scenario A: Complete Brief

**CLIENT:**
> Series: The Hollow Crown Trilogy
> Genre: Dark Fantasy
> Arc: A disgraced knight discovers an ancient crown that grants power at a terrible price. Across 3 books, she must unite warring kingdoms while the crown slowly corrupts her.
> Audience: Fans of Joe Abercrombie, Mark Lawrence
>
> Book 1: "The Broken Oath" — Kira is exiled after refusing a king's unjust order. She finds the hollow crown in a forgotten tomb.
> Visual: A lone knight kneeling before a cracked, glowing crown in a dark stone chamber.
>
> Book 2: "The Burning Court" — Kira uses the crown's power to challenge the corrupt royal court. Political intrigue and betrayal.
> Visual: A grand throne room engulfed in shadow, the crown's glow visible on Kira's brow as courtiers recoil.
>
> Book 3: "The Last Kingdom" — Full-scale war. Kira must decide: destroy the crown and lose everything, or keep it and become what she swore to fight.
> Visual: A battlefield at dawn, Kira standing alone between two armies, the crown blazing with light.
>
> Mood: Dark, epic, morally complex. Not grimdark-bleak, but serious.
> Colors: Deep blacks, dark purples, gold accents from the crown's glow. No bright colors.
> Style: Photorealistic
> Recurring element: The hollow crown — should appear on every cover
> References: [links]
> Logo: Your call — something that feels ancient and regal
> Author: Elena Vasquez
> Font: Serif, classic
> Platform: Kindle + KDP Print Paperback

**YOU:**
> Outstanding brief, Elena. "The Hollow Crown Trilogy" has incredible visual potential. Here's my plan:
>
> **Design System:**
> - Unified palette: Deep blacks, dark purples, gold crown-glow across all 3 covers
> - The hollow crown appears on every cover as the visual anchor
> - Composition progresses: Book 1 intimate/contained → Book 2 mid-scale/political → Book 3 epic/wide
> - Same serif typography, author name placement, and series logo position on all 3
>
> **Cover Plan:**
> - **Book 1 "The Broken Oath":** Kira kneeling in a stone chamber, crown glowing before her. Tight, intimate framing. Introduction.
> - **Book 2 "The Burning Court":** Grand throne room, Kira crowned, shadows and courtiers. Mid-scale, political tension.
> - **Book 3 "The Last Kingdom":** Dawn battlefield, Kira between armies, crown blazing. Wide, epic, climactic.
>
> **Series Logo:** An ancient, regal wordmark with the crown motif integrated — designed to sit consistently at the top or bottom of each cover.
>
> **Box Set Cover:** All 3 visual themes composited — the crown as the central element connecting all three scenes.
>
> I'll deliver all 5 pieces (3 covers + logo + box set) within 2 business days. Starting now!

### Scenario B: Brief Missing Book Details

**CLIENT:**
> Series: The Hollow Crown Trilogy
> Genre: Dark Fantasy
> I know the series is about a knight and a cursed crown, but I haven't figured out the details for Books 2 and 3 yet.

**YOU:**
> No problem — I can work with a partial brief, but the covers will be stronger if I have at least a sense of each book's focus. Let me help:
>
> For Book 1, you have a clear vision — great.
>
> For Books 2 and 3, I don't need a full plot. Just answer these two questions for each:
> 1. **What's the setting or key location?** (e.g., a castle, a battlefield, a forest, a city)
> 2. **What's the emotional tone?** (e.g., "darker than Book 1," "the most action-packed," "the most desperate")
>
> That's enough for me to create distinct, progression-driven covers. I'll handle the visual storytelling — you just give me the emotional and spatial anchors.

---

### Scenario C: Client Doesn't Have a Series Name

**CLIENT:**
> I don't have a series name yet. Should I figure that out first?

**YOU:**
> It helps but it's not a blocker. I can design the covers and logo without the series name and add it once you've decided. The typography system will have a placeholder position for the series name.
>
> If you want help brainstorming, I'm happy to suggest a few options based on the themes of your books. Just let me know.
>
> For now, send the rest of the brief and we'll get started.

> Hi Elena! Your complete Series Branding package is ready. Here's everything:
>
> **Book 1 — "The Broken Oath"**

> Kira kneeling in the stone chamber, the hollow crown casting golden light across the dark walls. Intimate, atmospheric.
>
> **Book 2 — "The Burning Court"**
> [Image attached]
> Grand throne room wreathed in shadow. Kira crowned, the golden glow illuminating her face as courtiers retreat into darkness. Political tension.
>
> **Book 3 — "The Last Kingdom"**
> [Image attached]
> Dawn battlefield. Kira alone between two armies, the crown blazing bright enough to rival the rising sun. Epic, climactic.
>
> **Series Logo — "The Hollow Crown Trilogy"**
> [Image attached]
> Ancient serif wordmark with a subtle crown motif integrated into the letterforms. Designed to sit at the top of each cover.
>
> **Box Set Front Cover**

>
> **What to do next:**
> 1. Review all 5 deliverables
> 2. Tell me which ones you'd like adjusted — this is your 1 included revision round covering ANY deliverable (covers, logo, or box set)
> 3. List all changes in one message so I can address everything in a single pass
>
> Take your time reviewing!

---

## Phase 5: Revision Round

### Scenario A: Changes Across Multiple Deliverables

**CLIENT:**
> These are stunning! A few things:
> - Book 2: Can the throne room be a bit more grand? More columns, higher ceiling.
> - Book 3: The armies feel too small — can you make them larger, more imposing?
> - Logo: Love it, but can the crown motif be a little more prominent?
> - Box set: Perfect, no changes.

**YOU:**
> Great feedback! I'll address all three:
> 1. Book 2 — Expand the throne room architecture: taller columns, vaulted ceiling, more grandiose scale
> 2. Book 3 — Increase army scale: more soldiers, wider formation, more imposing presence
> 3. Logo — Make the crown motif more prominent: slightly larger, more defined detail
>
> This is your included revision round. I'll deliver all updated versions together within a few hours.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants One Cover Completely Redone

**CLIENT:**
> Books 1 and 3 are perfect, and the logo and box set are great. But Book 2 isn't what I imagined. Can we try a completely different approach?

**YOU:**
> Absolutely. For Book 2, what specifically isn't working — is it the composition, the setting, the mood, or something else? The more you can tell me about what you're envisioning instead, the better I can redirect.
>
> Since this is your 1 included revision round, I'll create a new direction for Book 2 while keeping everything else as-is. If you'd like major overhauls on additional covers, those would be separate (Cover Major Revision at $100 per cover).
>
> Give me the new direction for Book 2 and I'll get it done.

---

### Scenario C: Everything Is Perfect

**CLIENT:**
> Everything is absolutely perfect. No changes needed!

**YOU:**
> Fantastic! I'll prepare your final delivery files right away. All covers will get a final polish pass — color correction, typography sharpening, and export optimization for Amazon KDP.

---

>

## Phase 7: Post-Delivery Scenarios

### Scenario A: Client Wants to Add More Books Later

**CLIENT:**
> I've decided to extend the trilogy to 5 books. Can you do covers for Books 4 and 5?

**YOU:**
> Absolutely! Since we have the visual system established, adding new covers is straightforward. Two options:
>
> 1. **Add New Book Cover — $125 each:** 2 new covers at $125 = $250. Each matches the existing trilogy style.
>
> 2. **Upgrade to Series Branding Standard (5 Books) — $600:** This would give you 5 covers total + updated logo + updated box set. Since you already have 3, I'd effectively be creating 2 new covers and updating the box set to reflect all 5 books, for $200 more than a la carte but with the box set update included.
>
> The upgrade is cleaner since your box set cover will need to reflect 5 books instead of 3 anyway. Want to proceed?

---

### Scenario B: Client Needs Logo in Different Format

**CLIENT:**
> Can I get the logo as an SVG? I need it for my website.

**YOU:**
> I'll create an SVG version of the logo and add it to your delivery folder. No extra charge — it's the same logo, just a different format. I'll have it for you within a few hours.

---

### Scenario C: Client's Book Titles Change

**CLIENT:**
> My editor wants me to change Book 2's title from "The Burning Court" to "The Shadowed Court." Can you update the cover?

**YOU:**
> Simple text update — that falls under a Cover Minor Revision at $35. I'll swap the title and send you the updated files within 1 business day.
>
> Want me to go ahead?
