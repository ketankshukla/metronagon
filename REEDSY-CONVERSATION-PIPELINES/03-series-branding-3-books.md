# Reedsy Conversation Pipeline — Series Branding: Starter / 3 Books ($400)

**Package:** Series Branding — Starter (3 Books)
**Price:** $400
**Delivery:** 2 business days
**Revisions:** 1 round included
**Deliverables:** 3 visually consistent front covers, series logo, box set front cover

---

## Phase 1: Initial Inquiry

### Scenario A: Client Inquires About Series Covers

**CLIENT:**

> Hi, I'm writing a 3-book fantasy series and I need covers for all of them. Do you do series work?

**YOU:**

> Hi! Absolutely — series branding is one of my core services. I've designed covers for three complete series on Amazon (22 books total), so I know exactly how to build visual consistency across multiple books.
>
> My Series Branding — Starter package is $400 for 3 books and includes:
>
> - 3 visually consistent front covers (Kindle + paperback ready)
> - Series logo (logomark + wordmark)
> - Box set front cover (for your Amazon box set listing)
> - 1 round of revisions on any deliverable
> - 2 business day delivery
>
> All covers share a unified color palette, typography system, and composition style — so they look like they belong together on Amazon, both individually and as a set.
>
> Would you like to move forward? I can send you the creative brief to get started.

---

### Scenario B: Client Asks Why Not Just Buy 3 Individual Covers

**CLIENT:**

> Couldn't I just buy 3 individual Standard covers? That would be $450 — only $50 more and I'd get 6 concepts instead of 3.

**YOU:**

> Good math! The difference isn't about concept count — it's about **consistency and extras.**
>
> With 3 individual covers, each one is designed independently. They might end up looking great individually but not cohesive as a series. Readers browse Amazon by thumbnail — if your 3 books don't instantly read as a set, you lose the "binge reader" effect.
>
> With the Series Branding package ($400):
>
> - All 3 covers are designed as a **unified system** from day one — same palette, same typography hierarchy, same composition logic
> - You get a **series logo** — a logomark and wordmark that anchors the whole series identity
> - You get a **box set front cover** — a separate image for your Amazon box set listing
> - The visual consistency drives binge reads — readers see Book 1, recognize Books 2 and 3 instantly
>
> You're saving $50 AND getting the logo + box set cover included. The branding package is the right move for a series.

---

### Scenario C: Client Has One Cover Already, Needs 2 More + Branding

**CLIENT:**

> I already have a cover for Book 1 that I like. Can you design Books 2 and 3 to match, plus give me a logo and box set cover?

**YOU:**

> Yes — I can work from your existing Book 1 cover as the style anchor. I'll match the palette, typography, and composition logic so Books 2 and 3 feel like they belong in the same series.
>
> Two options:
>
> **Option 1: Series Branding Starter ($400)** — I treat your existing Book 1 as the design reference and create 2 new matching covers + series logo + box set cover. Full package, unified result.
>
> **Option 2: 2x Add New Book Cover ($125 each = $250) + Logo ($100) + Box Set ($100) = $450** — A la carte pricing for the same deliverables, but $50 more.
>
> The branding package at $400 is the better deal. I'll use your Book 1 cover as the foundation and build the system around it.
>
> Want to proceed? Send me your Book 1 cover and I'll send the creative brief.

## AI Transparency & Client Consent (Reedsy Compliance — Required)

> **This disclosure must be sent BEFORE proceeding to the creative brief. Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, you must obtain the client's written consent before any AI-assisted tools are used in the project.**

After the client expresses interest and before sending the creative brief, send the following:

**YOU:**

> Before we move forward, I want to be fully transparent about my creative process — I share this with every client upfront, and Reedsy requires it.
>
> My design workflow uses **AI-assisted image generation** as a core part of the creative pipeline. I use advanced prompt engineering techniques to generate high-quality visual concepts, which I then refine, composite, color-grade, and finalize into production-ready cover art and visual assets.
>
> **What this means in practice:**
>
> - I translate your creative brief into detailed, genre-specific image generation prompts — each one carefully engineered to capture your series' characters, setting, mood, and genre conventions
> - Each concept goes through multiple rounds of generation, selection, and refinement — I generate dozens of variations and curate the strongest results
> - I composite, color-grade, and enhance the selected outputs to achieve a cohesive, polished visual system across all covers in your series
> - Typography, layout, logo design, and final production are handled with professional design precision
> - Every deliverable — covers, series logo, and box set cover — is a polished, commercially ready, print-quality product
>
> **What this does NOT mean:**
>
> - This is not "type a sentence and use the first thing that appears." Every visual goes through an extensive creative process driven by my expertise in book cover design, genre conventions, and Amazon marketplace requirements.
> - I've published 22 books across 3 series on Amazon — all designed using this exact pipeline. Maintaining visual consistency across an entire series is where this process truly shines.
>
> **Please take a look at my portfolio to see the quality this process delivers:**
>
> - https://metronagon.com/examples — cover gallery across multiple genres
> - https://metronagon.com/case-studies — complete series case studies showing visual consistency across multiple books
>
> Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, I need your written confirmation that you're comfortable with AI-assisted tools being part of the creative process before we proceed.
>
> Happy to answer any questions about how it works.

---

### Client Response: Accepts

**CLIENT:**

> That's totally fine with me. Your portfolio looks great — let's go!

**YOU:**

> Thank you — I appreciate both the trust and the chance to work on this. I'll note your consent in our project record and send you the creative brief next.

---

### Client Response: Has Questions About Quality / Uniqueness

**CLIENT:**

> I'm open to it, but I want to make sure my covers won't look "AI-generated" or generic. How do you ensure quality?

**YOU:**

> Completely fair concern, and one I take seriously. Here's how I deliver professional-grade results:
>
> 1. **Your brief drives every prompt.** I don't use templates or generic inputs. Every image generation prompt is custom-built from YOUR specific characters, settings, mood, color palette, and genre.
> 2. **Iterative refinement.** I generate dozens of variations per concept, then select, composite, and refine the strongest elements — it's a curation and design process, not a one-shot output.
> 3. **Series consistency.** This is where my process excels — I engineer prompts that maintain the same visual language, color palette, and compositional logic across every book in your series.
> 4. **Professional finishing.** Typography, composition, color grading, and production polish are all applied with the same rigor as any professional design workflow.
> 5. **Genre expertise.** I know what works on Amazon because I sell there myself. Your covers will look like they belong on a bestseller shelf.
>
> Check my case studies for proof: https://metronagon.com/case-studies — you'll see complete series with consistent visual identity across multiple books. That level of design intention doesn't happen by accident.
>
> If you're comfortable, just confirm and I'll send the creative brief!

---

### Client Response: Has Copyright Concerns

**CLIENT:**

> I've read that AI-generated images can't be copyrighted. Will that be a problem for my covers?

**YOU:**

> Important question — and one I take very seriously as a professional.
>
> You're right that the US Copyright Office has indicated that purely AI-generated images with minimal human input may lack full copyright protection on their own. However, my workflow involves substantial human creative direction at every stage: concept development, detailed prompt engineering, visual selection, compositing, refinement, typography, layout, and production design.
>
> The final products you receive are not raw AI outputs — they're professionally designed covers that reflect significant human creative decision-making throughout the entire process.
>
> As a Reedsy professional, I bear full legal responsibility for ensuring that your deliverables are commercially exploitable and free of copyright issues. That's my obligation to you, and I stand behind it completely.
>
> You'll receive production-ready files that you can use commercially on Amazon, IngramSpark, or any other publishing platform without restriction.

---

### Client Response: Declines AI-Assisted Work

**CLIENT:**

> I appreciate the honesty, but I'd prefer a designer who works without AI tools. Nothing personal.

**YOU:**

> No offense taken at all — I genuinely respect that preference, and I'd always rather be upfront than surprise you later.
>
> I'd suggest browsing Reedsy's other designers who specialize in hand-illustrated or traditional digital painting approaches. If you ever want to see what my pipeline can deliver, my portfolio is always open: https://metronagon.com/examples
>
> Best of luck with your series!

---

## Phase 2: Creative Brief Request

**YOU:**

> Here's the creative brief for your 3-book series. This is the most important document in the process — the more detail you provide, the stronger and more cohesive your series will look.
>
> **CREATIVE BRIEF — Series Branding (3 Books)**
>
> **1. Series Overview**
>
> - Series name (if you have one):
> - Genre:
> - Brief series description (3-4 sentences about the overall story arc):
> - Target audience — Who is your ideal reader?
>
> **2. Individual Book Details**
>
> _Book 1:_
>
> - Title (and subtitle, if any):
> - Brief description (2-3 sentences — what happens in this book?):
> - Key visual element or scene — What should this cover convey?
>
> _Book 2:_
>

>
> **5. Logo and Typography**
>

> - Author name (exactly as it should appear on all covers):
> - Font style preference — Serif, sans-serif, script, display? Or "your call":

> - Where will this be published? (Amazon Kindle, KDP Print Paperback, or KDP Print Hardcover?):
>
> Take your time. Once I have this, I'll design all 3 covers, the logo, and the box set cover as one unified system.

---

## Phase 3: Receiving the Brief

### Scenario A: Complete Brief

**CLIENT:**

> Series: The Hollow Crown Trilogy
> Genre: Dark Fantasy
> Arc: A disgraced knight discovers an ancient crown that grants power at a terrible price. Across 3 books, she must unite warring kingdoms while the crown slowly corrupts her.
> Audience: Fans of Joe Abercrombie, Mark Lawrence
>
> Book 1: "The Broken Oath" — Kira is exiled after refusing a king's unjust order. She finds the hollow crown in a forgotten tomb.
> Visual: A lone knight kneeling before a cracked, glowing crown in a dark stone chamber.
>
> Book 2: "The Burning Court" — Kira uses the crown's power to challenge the corrupt royal court. Political intrigue and betrayal.
> Visual: A grand throne room engulfed in shadow, the crown's glow visible on Kira's brow as courtiers recoil.
>
> Book 3: "The Last Kingdom" — Full-scale war. Kira must decide: destroy the crown and lose everything, or keep it and become what she swore to fight.
> Visual: A battlefield at dawn, Kira standing alone between two armies, the crown blazing with light.
>
> Mood: Dark, epic, morally complex. Not grimdark-bleak, but serious.
> Colors: Deep blacks, dark purples, gold accents from the crown's glow. No bright colors.
> Style: Photorealistic
> Recurring element: The hollow crown — should appear on every cover
> References: [links]
> Logo: Your call — something that feels ancient and regal
> Author: Elena Vasquez
> Font: Serif, classic
> Platform: Kindle + KDP Print Paperback

**YOU:**

> Outstanding brief, Elena. "The Hollow Crown Trilogy" has incredible visual potential. Here's my plan:
>
> **Design System:**
>
> - Unified palette: Deep blacks, dark purples, gold crown-glow across all 3 covers
> - The hollow crown appears on every cover as the visual anchor
> - Composition progresses: Book 1 intimate/contained → Book 2 mid-scale/political → Book 3 epic/wide
> - Same serif typography, author name placement, and series logo position on all 3
>
> **Cover Plan:**
>
> - **Book 1 "The Broken Oath":** Kira kneeling in a stone chamber, crown glowing before her. Tight, intimate framing. Introduction.
> - **Book 2 "The Burning Court":** Grand throne room, Kira crowned, shadows and courtiers. Mid-scale, political tension.
> - **Book 3 "The Last Kingdom":** Dawn battlefield, Kira between armies, crown blazing. Wide, epic, climactic.
>
> **Series Logo:** An ancient, regal wordmark with the crown motif integrated — designed to sit consistently at the top or bottom of each cover.
>
> **Box Set Cover:** All 3 visual themes composited — the crown as the central element connecting all three scenes.
>
> I'll deliver all 5 pieces (3 covers + logo + box set) within 2 business days. Starting now!

### Scenario B: Brief Missing Book Details

**CLIENT:**

> Series: The Hollow Crown Trilogy
> Genre: Dark Fantasy
> I know the series is about a knight and a cursed crown, but I haven't figured out the details for Books 2 and 3 yet.

**YOU:**

> No problem — I can work with a partial brief, but the covers will be stronger if I have at least a sense of each book's focus. Let me help:
>
> For Book 1, you have a clear vision — great.
>
> For Books 2 and 3, I don't need a full plot. Just answer these two questions for each:
>
> 1. **What's the setting or key location?** (e.g., a castle, a battlefield, a forest, a city)
> 2. **What's the emotional tone?** (e.g., "darker than Book 1," "the most action-packed," "the most desperate")
>
> That's enough for me to create distinct, progression-driven covers. I'll handle the visual storytelling — you just give me the emotional and spatial anchors.

---

### Scenario C: Client Doesn't Have a Series Name

**CLIENT:**

> I don't have a series name yet. Should I figure that out first?

**YOU:**

> It helps but it's not a blocker. I can design the covers and logo without the series name and add it once you've decided. The typography system will have a placeholder position for the series name.
>
> If you want help brainstorming, I'm happy to suggest a few options based on the themes of your books. Just let me know.
>
> For now, send the rest of the brief and we'll get started.

---

## Phase 4: Deliverables Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi Elena! Your complete Series Branding package is ready. Here's everything:
>
> **Book 1 — "The Broken Oath"** > [Image attached]
> Kira kneeling in the stone chamber, the hollow crown casting golden light across the dark walls. Intimate, atmospheric.
>
> **Book 2 — "The Burning Court"** > [Image attached]
> Grand throne room wreathed in shadow. Kira crowned, the golden glow illuminating her face as courtiers retreat into darkness. Political tension.
>
> **Book 3 — "The Last Kingdom"** > [Image attached]
> Dawn battlefield. Kira alone between two armies, the crown blazing bright enough to rival the rising sun. Epic, climactic.
>
> **Series Logo — "The Hollow Crown Trilogy"** > [Image attached]
> Ancient serif wordmark with a subtle crown motif integrated into the letterforms. Designed to sit at the top of each cover.
>
> **Box Set Front Cover** > [Image attached]
> Composite design — the crown as the central element, fragments of all 3 cover scenes flowing outward. Represents the full trilogy as a single product.
>
> **What to do next:**
>
> 1. Review all 5 deliverables
> 2. Tell me which ones you'd like adjusted — this is your 1 included revision round covering ANY deliverable (covers, logo, or box set)
> 3. List all changes in one message so I can address everything in a single pass
>
> Take your time reviewing!

---

## Phase 5: Revision Round

### Scenario A: Changes Across Multiple Deliverables

**CLIENT:**

> These are stunning! A few things:
>
> - Book 2: Can the throne room be a bit more grand? More columns, higher ceiling.
> - Book 3: The armies feel too small — can you make them larger, more imposing?
> - Logo: Love it, but can the crown motif be a little more prominent?
> - Box set: Perfect, no changes.

**YOU:**

> Great feedback! I'll address all three:
>
> 1. Book 2 — Expand the throne room architecture: taller columns, vaulted ceiling, more grandiose scale
> 2. Book 3 — Increase army scale: more soldiers, wider formation, more imposing presence
> 3. Logo — Make the crown motif more prominent: slightly larger, more defined detail
>
> This is your included revision round. I'll deliver all updated versions together within a few hours.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants One Cover Completely Redone

**CLIENT:**

> Books 1 and 3 are perfect, and the logo and box set are great. But Book 2 isn't what I imagined. Can we try a completely different approach?

**YOU:**

> Absolutely. For Book 2, what specifically isn't working — is it the composition, the setting, the mood, or something else? The more you can tell me about what you're envisioning instead, the better I can redirect.
>
> Since this is your 1 included revision round, I'll create a new direction for Book 2 while keeping everything else as-is. If you'd like major overhauls on additional covers, those would be separate (Cover Major Revision at $100 per cover).
>
> Give me the new direction for Book 2 and I'll get it done.

---

### Scenario C: Everything Is Perfect

**CLIENT:**

> Everything is absolutely perfect. No changes needed!

**YOU:**

> Fantastic! I'll prepare your final delivery files right away. All covers will get a final polish pass — color correction, typography sharpening, and export optimization for Amazon KDP.

---

## Phase 6: Final Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi Elena! Your complete Series Branding package is finalized and ready.
>
> **Final Delivery — The Hollow Crown Trilogy**

>
> **Files delivered via:** Google Drive link

> - **Kindle:** Upload each cover PNG/JPG as the ebook cover in KDP
> - **KDP Print Paperback:** Upload each as the front cover, use Amazon's Cover Creator for spine and back
> - **Box Set:** Upload the box set cover for your Amazon box set listing
> - **Logo:** Use on your Amazon author page, social media, website, marketing materials
>
> Please download everything and verify — check all titles, author name spelling, and that the covers look consistent side by side and at thumbnail size.
>
> It's been a pleasure creating The Hollow Crown Trilogy's visual identity! A Reedsy review would mean a lot if you're happy with the work. And when you need more books, returning clients get 10% off!

---

## Phase 7: Post-Delivery Scenarios

### Scenario A: Client Wants to Add More Books Later

**CLIENT:**

> I've decided to extend the trilogy to 5 books. Can you do covers for Books 4 and 5?

**YOU:**

> Absolutely! Since we have the visual system established, adding new covers is straightforward. Two options:
>
> 1. **Add New Book Cover — $125 each:** 2 new covers at $125 = $250. Each matches the existing trilogy style.
>
> 2. **Upgrade to Series Branding Standard (5 Books) — $600:** This would give you 5 covers total + updated logo + updated box set. Since you already have 3, I'd effectively be creating 2 new covers and updating the box set to reflect all 5 books, for $200 more than a la carte but with the box set update included.
>
> The upgrade is cleaner since your box set cover will need to reflect 5 books instead of 3 anyway. Want to proceed?

---

### Scenario B: Client Needs Logo in Different Format

**CLIENT:**

> Can I get the logo as an SVG? I need it for my website.

**YOU:**

> I'll create an SVG version of the logo and add it to your delivery folder. No extra charge — it's the same logo, just a different format. I'll have it for you within a few hours.

---

### Scenario C: Client's Book Titles Change

**CLIENT:**

> My editor wants me to change Book 2's title from "The Burning Court" to "The Shadowed Court." Can you update the cover?

**YOU:**

> Simple text update — that falls under a Cover Minor Revision at $35. I'll swap the title and send you the updated files within 1 business day.
>
> Want me to go ahead?

---

## Follow-Up Template (If Client Goes Silent)

After 3 days:

**YOU:**

> Hi Elena! Just checking in — wanted to make sure you received all the deliverables and see if you have any feedback. Your revision round is still available whenever you're ready. No rush!

After 7 days:

**YOU:**

> Hi Elena — following up once more. Your project is saved and your revision round is still active. Whenever you're ready to review, just send your feedback and I'll get right on it. If plans have changed, no worries — just let me know!
