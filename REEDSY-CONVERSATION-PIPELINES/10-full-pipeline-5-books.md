---

## Phase 1: Initial Inquiry

### Scenario A: Client Wants a Complete 5-Book Launch Package

**CLIENT:**

> Hi, I'm launching a 5-book romance series and I need covers, branding, and book descriptions — all matching, all professional. What do you have?

**YOU:**

> Hi! My Full Pipeline — Standard package ($850) is exactly what you need. It's the complete launch package for a 5-book series:
>
> - 5 visually consistent front covers (Kindle + paperback ready, 1600x2400, 300 DPI)
> - Series logo (logomark + wordmark)
> - Box set front cover
> - 5 keyword-optimized Amazon book descriptions — each one a conversion-focused hook
> - 2 rounds of revisions on any deliverable (covers AND descriptions)
> - 3 business day delivery
>
> Everything designed and written as a unified system — your covers look like they belong together, your descriptions follow a consistent voice, and your Amazon presence is polished from day one.
>
> I've published 22 books across 3 series on Amazon, so I know both the visual and the copy side of what makes a series sell.
>
> Want to get started?

---

### Scenario B: Client Comparing Pipeline vs Branding + Separate Copywriter

**CLIENT:**

> I was thinking of getting branding from you ($600) and hiring a copywriter for the descriptions separately. Is the Pipeline worth it?

**YOU:**

> Good question. Let's compare:
>
> **Option 1: Branding ($600) + separate copywriter**
>
> - Branding: $600 (5 covers + logo + box set)
> - Copywriter on Reedsy: $150-$300 for 5 descriptions (typical range)
> - Total: $750-$900
> - Coordination: You manage two professionals separately
>
> **Option 2: Full Pipeline ($850)**
>
> - Everything in one package: covers + logo + box set + 5 descriptions
> - Total: $850
> - Coordination: One person, one brief, one delivery
>
> The Pipeline is competitively priced AND you get a single person who understands both the visual and verbal identity of your series. The descriptions I write are informed by the same creative brief as the covers — the visual mood and the copy tone match perfectly.
>
> Plus, I've written descriptions for all 22 of my own Amazon books, so I know the format, the keywords, and what converts.

---

### Scenario C: Client Asks About Description Quality

**CLIENT:**

> How good are the book descriptions? I've seen bad AI-generated blurbs that sound generic.

**YOU:**

> Fair concern. My descriptions are not template-generated or generic. Here's how I write them:
>
> 1. **I read your brief deeply** — I understand your characters, conflicts, stakes, and tone before writing a single word
> 2. **Keyword research** — I identify the Amazon search terms your target readers actually use (genre keywords, tropes, comparable authors)
> 3. **Conversion structure** — Every description follows a proven format: hook → stakes → emotional pull → call to action
> 4. **Genre-appropriate voice** — A grimdark fantasy description sounds completely different from a cozy mystery. I match the voice to the genre.
> 5. **Amazon formatting** — Proper HTML formatting with bold text, line breaks, and pacing that works in Amazon's product description field
>
> I've written descriptions for 22 of my own published Amazon titles. They're not generic — they're specific, hook-driven, and written to sell YOUR book to YOUR reader.
>
> If you'd like to see my style, check the descriptions on any of my Amazon listings — they use the same approach I'll use for yours.

---

## AI Transparency & Client Consent (Reedsy Compliance — Required)

> **This disclosure must be sent BEFORE proceeding to the creative brief. Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, you must obtain the client's written consent before any AI-assisted tools are used in the project.**

After the client expresses interest and before sending the creative brief, send the following:

**YOU:**

> Before we move forward, I want to be fully transparent about my creative process — I share this with every client upfront, and Reedsy requires it.
>
> My design workflow uses **AI-assisted image generation** as a core part of the creative pipeline for all visual deliverables. I use advanced prompt engineering techniques to generate high-quality visual concepts, which I then refine, composite, color-grade, and finalize into production-ready cover art and visual assets.
>
> **What this means in practice for your visual deliverables (covers, logo, box set):**
>
> - I translate your creative brief into detailed, genre-specific image generation prompts — each one carefully engineered to capture your series' characters, setting, mood, and genre conventions
> - Each concept goes through multiple rounds of generation, selection, and refinement — I generate dozens of variations and curate the strongest results
> - I composite, color-grade, and enhance the selected outputs to achieve a cohesive, polished visual system across all covers in your series
> - Typography, layout, logo design, and final production are handled with professional design precision
> - Every visual deliverable is a polished, commercially ready, print-quality product — not a raw AI output
>
> **A note on your Amazon book descriptions:** The keyword-optimized book descriptions included in this package are **written work** — crafted by me based on your story details, genre keywords, and conversion principles. The AI transparency above applies specifically to the visual deliverables (covers, series logo, box set cover).
>
> **What this does NOT mean:**
>
> - This is not "type a sentence and use the first thing that appears." Every visual goes through an extensive creative process driven by my expertise in book cover design, genre conventions, and Amazon marketplace requirements.
> - I've published 22 books across 3 series on Amazon — all designed using this exact pipeline. Maintaining visual consistency across an entire series is where this process truly shines.
>
> **Please take a look at my portfolio to see the quality this process delivers:**
>
> - https://metronagon.com/ai-transparency — full details on my AI-assisted process, copyright protections, and a real example prompt
> - https://metronagon.com/examples — cover gallery across multiple genres
> - https://metronagon.com/case-studies — complete series case studies showing visual consistency across multiple books
>
> Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, I need your written confirmation that you're comfortable with AI-assisted tools being part of the creative process for the visual deliverables before we proceed.
>
> Happy to answer any questions about how it works.

### Client Response: Accepts

**CLIENT:**

> That's totally fine with me. Your portfolio looks great — let's go!

**YOU:**

> Thank you — I appreciate both the trust and the chance to work on this. I'll note your consent in our project record and send you the creative brief next.

---

### Client Response: Has Questions About Quality / Uniqueness

**CLIENT:**

> I'm open to it, but I want to make sure my covers won't look "AI-generated" or generic. How do you ensure quality?

**YOU:**

> Completely fair concern, and one I take seriously. Here's how I deliver professional-grade results:
>
> 1. **Your brief drives every prompt.** I don't use templates or generic inputs. Every image generation prompt is custom-built from YOUR specific characters, settings, mood, color palette, and genre.
> 2. **Iterative refinement.** I generate dozens of variations per concept, then select, composite, and refine the strongest elements — it's a curation and design process, not a one-shot output.
> 3. **Series consistency.** This is where my process excels — I engineer prompts that maintain the same visual language, color palette, and compositional logic across every book in your series.
> 4. **Professional finishing.** Typography, composition, color grading, and production polish are all applied with the same rigor as any professional design workflow.
> 5. **Genre expertise.** I know what works on Amazon because I sell there myself. Your covers will look like they belong on a bestseller shelf.
>
> And remember — the book descriptions are written by me from scratch based on your story details and genre keywords. No AI generation there — just conversion-focused copywriting from someone who's written descriptions for 22 Amazon titles.
>
> Check my case studies for proof: https://metronagon.com/case-studies — you'll see complete series with consistent visual identity across multiple books. That level of design intention doesn't happen by accident.
>
> If you're comfortable, just confirm and I'll send the creative brief!

---

### Client Response: Has Copyright Concerns

**CLIENT:**

> I've read that AI-generated images can't be copyrighted. Will that be a problem for my covers?

**YOU:**

> Important question — and one I take very seriously as a professional.
>
> You're right that the US Copyright Office has indicated that purely AI-generated images with minimal human input may lack full copyright protection on their own. However, my workflow involves substantial human creative direction at every stage: concept development, detailed prompt engineering, visual selection, compositing, refinement, typography, layout, and production design.
>
> The final products you receive are not raw AI outputs — they're professionally designed covers that reflect significant human creative decision-making throughout the entire process.
>
> As a Reedsy professional, I bear full legal responsibility for ensuring that your deliverables are commercially exploitable and free of copyright issues. That's my obligation to you, and I stand behind it completely.
>
> You'll receive production-ready files that you can use commercially on Amazon, IngramSpark, or any other publishing platform without restriction.
>
> As for the book descriptions — those are original written work and are fully copyrightable without question.

---

### Client Response: Declines AI-Assisted Work

**CLIENT:**

> I appreciate the honesty, but I'd prefer a designer who works without AI tools. Nothing personal.

**YOU:**

> No offense taken at all — I genuinely respect that preference, and I'd always rather be upfront than surprise you later.
>
> I'd suggest browsing Reedsy's other designers who specialize in hand-illustrated or traditional digital painting approaches. If you ever want to see what my pipeline can deliver, my portfolio is always open: https://metronagon.com/examples
>
> Best of luck with your series!

---

## Phase 2: Creative Brief Request

**YOU:**

> Here's the creative brief for the Full Pipeline. It covers visual direction (covers, logo, box set) and content direction (descriptions), so I need a bit more detail than a branding-only brief.
>
> **CREATIVE BRIEF — Full Pipeline (5 Books)**
>
> **1. Series Overview**
>
> - Series name (if you have one):
> - Genre:
> - Brief series description (4-6 sentences about the overall story arc):
> - Target audience — Who is your ideal reader? What comparable authors/series do they read?
>
> **2. Individual Book Details (for each of the 5 books)**
>
> _Book 1:_
>
> - Title (and subtitle, if any):
> - Plot summary (3-5 sentences — what happens? Main conflict, stakes, hook):
> - Main character(s) — Who they are, what they want, what stands in their way:
> - Key visual element or scene for the cover:
> - Emotional tone of this book (within the series arc):
>
> _Book 2:_ > [Same fields]
>
> _Book 3:_ > [Same fields]
>
> _Book 4:_ > [Same fields]
>
> _Book 5:_ > [Same fields]
>
> **3. Visual Direction (for covers)**
>
> - Mood/tone:
> - Color palette preferences:
> - Style preference — Photorealistic or stylized?
> - Key recurring visual element:
> - Visual progression — Should covers evolve across the series?
>
> **4. Reference Covers**
>
> - 3-5 existing covers or series you admire:
> - Covers you DON'T like:
>
> **5. Logo and Typography**
>
> - Series logo direction:
> - Author name (exactly as it should appear):
> - Font style preference:
>
> **6. Book Descriptions (additional info)**
>
> - Keywords to include (genre tropes, themes, keywords readers search for):
> - Comparable titles or authors to reference in descriptions:
> - Description tone — Dramatic? Mysterious? Playful? Action-packed? Emotional?
> - Any content warnings, tropes, or categories to highlight:
> - Anything that should NOT be revealed in descriptions (spoiler boundaries):
>
> **7. Publishing Platform**
>
> - Where will this be published?
> - Amazon categories you're targeting (if known):
> - Amazon keywords (the 7 backend keyword fields, if you have them):
>
> The plot summaries in Section 2 are critical for both covers AND descriptions. The more I know about each book, the more targeted the visual and the copy will be.

## Phase 3: Receiving the Brief

### Scenario A: Complete Brief

**CLIENT:**

> [Sends complete brief with all 5 books detailed, references, keywords, comparable authors, description tone preferences]

**YOU:**

> Outstanding brief — this gives me everything I need for all 12 deliverables. Here's my plan:
>
> **Design System:**
>
> - [Palette, typography, recurring motif, progression]
>
> **Cover Plan:**
>
> - Book 1: [Key visual + mood]
> - Book 2: [Key visual + mood]
> - Book 3: [Key visual + mood]
> - Book 4: [Key visual + mood]
> - Book 5: [Key visual + mood]
>
> **Series Logo:** [Description]
>
> **Box Set Cover:** [Description]
>
> **Description Strategy:**
>
> - Voice: [Matching genre and tone preference]
> - Structure: Hook → character intro → stakes → escalation → cliffhanger/CTA
> - Keywords woven naturally: [List key terms]
> - Comp reference: "[Comparable author/title]" mentioned in Book 1 description, organic throughout the rest
> - Spoiler boundary: [What I'll avoid revealing]
>
> I'll deliver everything within 3 business days. Starting now!

---

### Scenario B: Good Visual Brief, Weak Description Info

**CLIENT:**

> [Detailed visual direction but only 1-2 sentences per book for the plot/description section]

**YOU:**

> The visual direction is great — I have everything I need for the covers. But for the descriptions, I'll need a bit more story detail.
>
> For each book, can you add:
>
> 1. **Who is the protagonist** and what do they want?
> 2. **What's the main obstacle** or conflict?
> 3. **What's at stake** — what happens if they fail?
>
> Even 3-4 sentences covering these points will let me write descriptions that hook the right reader. Without this, I'd be writing generic genre blurbs instead of specific, compelling ones.
>
> I'll start on the covers now and will integrate the descriptions once I have the story details.

---

## Phase 4: Deliverables Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi [Client]! Your complete Full Pipeline package is ready. Here's everything:
>
> ---

>
> > [Full description]
>
> **Book 5 — "[Title]"**
>

>
> ---
>
> **What to do next:**
>
> 1. Review all 12 deliverables
> 2. For covers: visual consistency, titles, author name, thumbnail readability
> 3. For descriptions: accuracy, tone, no spoilers, keyword presence, compelling hooks
> 4. List ALL changes in one message — Revision Round 1 of 2
>
> **Tip for descriptions:** Read each one as if you're a reader browsing Amazon who has never heard of this series. Does the description make you want to click "Buy"? That's the test.

---

## Phase 5: Revision Round 1

### Scenario A: Mixed Cover and Description Feedback

**CLIENT:**

> Covers:
>
> - Book 3 needs a warmer palette — it's the romance peak of the series
> - Book 5 title text needs to be larger
>
> Descriptions:
>
> - Book 1 is perfect
> - Book 2: Can you mention the "second chance" trope? My readers search for that
> - Book 3: The opening hook is weak — needs to be more emotional
> - Book 4: Too many spoilers from Book 3 in the setup. Dial back.
> - Book 5: Perfect

**YOU:**

> Clear notes. I'll address all five:
>
> **Covers:**
>
> 1. Book 3 — Shift palette warmer: rose golds, warm ambers, softer lighting to match the romance peak
> 2. Book 5 — Increase title text size for stronger thumbnail impact
>
> **Descriptions:** 3. Book 2 — Weave "second chance romance" naturally into the character setup 4. Book 3 — Rewrite the opening hook to lead with emotion: heart-first, stakes second 5. Book 4 — Pull back on Book 3 references. Set up Book 4's conflict without revealing Book 3's resolution.
>
> Revision Round 1 of 2. All updates delivered together.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants All Descriptions Rewritten in Different Style

**CLIENT:**

> The covers are perfect. But I showed the descriptions to my author friends and they think the tone is wrong — too action-heavy for a romance series. Can you rewrite all 5 with more emotional hooks?

**YOU:**

> Absolutely. I'll pivot all 5 descriptions to lead with emotional hooks:
>
> - Character feelings and desires first
> - Relationship tension and chemistry front and center
> - Stakes framed emotionally ("she could lose everything she's finally found") rather than plot-mechanically
> - Same keywords and genre positioning, just a warmer, more heart-driven voice
>
> This uses Revision Round 1. You'll still have Round 2 for final fine-tuning.
>
> Any specific lines from the original descriptions you liked that I should carry over?

---

## Phase 6: Revision Round 2

### Scenario A: Final Polish on Descriptions

**CLIENT:**

> The rewritten descriptions are so much better! Just two small things:
>
> - Book 2: Can you change "former rivals" to "former best friends"? That's more accurate.
> - Book 4: Can the last sentence be punchier? End on a question.

**YOU:**

> Easy fixes:
>
> 1. Book 2 — "former rivals" → "former best friends"
> 2. Book 4 — Rewrite final sentence as a punchy, suspenseful question
>
> Round 2 of 2. I'll apply these and prepare final delivery files.

---

### Scenario B: Client Happy After Round 1

**CLIENT:**

> Everything from Round 1 is perfect. Ship it!

**YOU:**

> Done! I'll do a final quality pass on all deliverables and prepare your files. Round 2 is still available if you spot anything after receiving the finals.

---

## Phase 7: Final Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi [Client]! Your complete Full Pipeline package is finalized.
>
> **Final Delivery — [Series Name] (5 Books)**

> - `[Series]-Logo-Dark.png` (for light backgrounds)
>
> **Box Set Cover:**

> - `[Series]-BoxSet-FINAL.png / .jpg`
>
> **Amazon Book Descriptions:**
>
> - `Book-Descriptions.docx` — All 5 descriptions, each with HTML-formatted and plain text versions
>
> **Files delivered via:** Google Drive link (organized: /Covers, /Logo, /BoxSet, /Descriptions)
>
> **How to use descriptions in KDP:**
>
> 1. Go to your book's listing → Book Description
> 2. Copy the HTML version for best formatting (bold text, line breaks)
> 3. Or paste plain text and format manually
> 4. Preview before publishing — check that formatting renders correctly
>
> Please verify everything. For descriptions: read each one aloud, check for typos, and confirm no spoilers cross book boundaries.
>
> Thank you for trusting me with the full pipeline! A Reedsy review would mean everything. Returning clients get 10% off!

---

## Phase 8: Post-Delivery Scenarios

### Scenario A: Client Wants Description Updates After Launch

**CLIENT:**

> Book 1 has been live for a month. I want to update the description based on reader reviews and new keywords. Can you revise it?

**YOU:**

> Absolutely! Book Description Update: $35. I'll revise using new keywords, reader language, and any positioning changes. 1 business day.
>
> Returning client discount: **$31.50**.
>
> Send me the new direction and any specific keywords or phrases from reviews you want incorporated.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants to Expand to 10 Books

**CLIENT:**

> The series is expanding to 10 books. Can you do the next 5?

**YOU:**

> Congratulations! Two options:
>
> 1. **5x Add New Book Cover ($125 each = $625) + 5x Book Description ($35 each = $175) = $800**
>
> 2. **Upgrade to Full Pipeline Premium (10 Books) at $1,350.** You've paid $850, so the upgrade is $500 for 5 new covers + 5 new descriptions + updated box set cover.
>
> The upgrade saves you $300 AND includes an updated box set cover for the full 10-book collection. Much better value.
>
> Want to proceed?

---

### Scenario C: Client Wants Descriptions in Different Language

**CLIENT:**

> I'm publishing in German too. Can you write German descriptions?

**YOU:**

> I write descriptions in English only. For German translations, I'd recommend:
>
> 1. Hiring a German-language copywriter on Reedsy to adapt the descriptions
> 2. The English descriptions serve as the foundation — a translator can match the tone and keywords for the German market
>
> I can provide the English descriptions in a format that makes translation easy (clear structure, keyword list, tone notes).
