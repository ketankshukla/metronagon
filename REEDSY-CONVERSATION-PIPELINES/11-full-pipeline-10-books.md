---

## Phase 1: Initial Inquiry

### Scenario A: Client Has a Large Series and Wants Everything

**CLIENT:**
> Hi, I'm launching a 10-book epic fantasy series and I need the full package — covers, branding, and descriptions for all 10 books. What's your biggest package?

**YOU:**
> Hi! My Full Pipeline — Premium is exactly this. It's $1,350 for the complete 10-book package:
>
> - 10 visually consistent front covers (Kindle + paperback ready, 1600x2400, 300 DPI)
> - Series logo (logomark + wordmark)
> - Box set front cover
> - 10 keyword-optimized Amazon book descriptions
> - 2 rounds of revisions on any deliverable (covers AND descriptions)
> - 4 business day delivery
>
> That's $135 per book for cover + description + your share of the logo and box set. It's the best value I offer — and everything is designed and written as a single cohesive system.
>
> I've done this exact thing for my own 12-book Aztec Samurai Adventures series on Amazon — 12 visually consistent covers, logo, box set cover, and descriptions all built from the same creative pipeline. I know what it takes to maintain consistency and quality across this many books.
>
> Ready to get started? I'll send the creative brief.

---

### Scenario B: Client Calculating Cost vs A La Carte

**CLIENT:**
> If I bought 10 individual covers ($150 each = $1,500) plus 10 descriptions separately, it would cost way more. Is the Pipeline really all-inclusive?

**YOU:**
> Correct — here's the full comparison:
>
> **A la carte:**
> - 10 individual Standard covers: $1,500
> - 10 book descriptions: $350 (at $35 each)
> - Series logo: $100+
> - Box set cover: $100+
> - Total: ~$2,050+
>
> **Full Pipeline Premium: $1,350**
>
> You save $700+ AND get:
> - All 10 covers designed as a unified visual system (not 10 separate projects)
> - Descriptions written by the same person who designed the covers (matching visual and verbal identity)
> - Logo and box set included
> - 2 revision rounds covering everything
>
> It's genuinely all-inclusive. The only thing not included is rush delivery (+50% if you need it in 48 hours, but the standard 4-day turnaround is fast enough for most launches).

---

### Scenario C: Client Worried About Managing a 10-Book Brief

**CLIENT:**
> 10 books is a lot of info to provide. How detailed does the brief need to be?

**YOU:**
> I understand the concern. Here's the minimum I need to create great work:
>
> **For covers (minimum per book):**
> - Title
> - One key visual element or scene (even one sentence: "a sword in a stone" or "a city on fire")
>
> **For descriptions (minimum per book):**
> - 3-5 sentence plot summary (who, what, conflict, stakes)
>
> **For the series as a whole:**
> - Genre, series name, author name
> - 3 reference covers you admire
> - General mood/color preferences
>
> That's it. I'll handle palette, typography, composition, logo design, visual progression, keyword research, and description structure.
>
> If some books are still in development, give me what you have — even working titles and rough ideas. I'll design covers and descriptions that fit the system and can be refined later ($35 per text update, $100 for a major cover revision).
>
> The brief looks long but most of it is optional. Send what you have and I'll make it work.

---

### Scenario D: Client Asks About Staged Delivery

**CLIENT:**
> Can you deliver in batches? I want to start publishing Books 1-3 while you finish the rest.

**YOU:**
> Absolutely. For a 10-book package, I can deliver in stages:
>
> - **Stage 1 (Day 2):** Books 1-3 covers + descriptions + series logo — enough to start publishing
> - **Stage 2 (Day 3):** Books 4-7 covers + descriptions
> - **Stage 3 (Day 4):** Books 8-10 covers + descriptions + box set cover
>
> You can start uploading to KDP as each stage arrives. The revision rounds apply across all stages — you can give feedback on Stage 1 while I'm building Stage 2, or hold all feedback until the end.
>
> Want to proceed with staged delivery?

---

## Phase 2: Creative Brief Request

**YOU:**
> Here's the creative brief for the 10-book Full Pipeline. This is the most comprehensive brief I send, but remember — provide what you have, and I'll handle the creative decisions for any gaps.
>
> **CREATIVE BRIEF — Full Pipeline (10 Books)**
>
> **1. Series Overview**
> - Series name (if you have one):
> - Genre:
> - Brief series description (4-6 sentences — the full arc across 10 books):
> - Target audience — Who is your ideal reader? Comparable authors/series?
> - Total number of books planned (if more than 10):
>
> **2. Individual Book Details (for each of the 10 books)**
>
> For each book, provide:
> - Title (and subtitle, if any):
> - Plot summary (3-5 sentences — main conflict, stakes, hook):
> - Main character(s) — Who they are and their arc in this book:
> - Key visual element or scene for the cover:
> - Emotional position in the series (e.g., "the setup," "the darkest point," "the turning point," "the finale"):
>
> *Book 1:* ...
> *Book 2:* ...
> [through Book 10]
>
> **3. Visual Direction (for covers)**
> - Mood/tone:
> - Color palette preferences:
> - Style preference — Photorealistic or stylized?
> - Key recurring visual element:
> - Visual progression — Should covers evolve across the series?
>
> **4. Reference Covers**
> - 3-5 existing covers or series you admire (especially long series):
> - Covers you DON'T like:
>
> **5. Logo and Typography**
> - Series logo direction:
> - Author name:
> - Font style preference:
>
> **6. Book Descriptions**
> - Keywords to include (genre tropes, themes, search terms):
> - Comparable titles/authors to reference:
> - Description tone:
> - Spoiler boundaries — What should NOT be revealed in descriptions?
> - Any specific tropes or content tags to highlight:
>
> **7. Publishing Platform**
> - Where will this be published?
> - Amazon categories:
> - Amazon backend keywords (if you have them):
>
> **Tip:** If you only have detailed info for some books, that's fine. Give me what you have. For the rest, even a working title + one sentence about the focus is enough. I'll design and write around what exists and you can refine later.

---

## Phase 3: Receiving the Brief

### Scenario A: Complete Brief (All 10 Books)

**CLIENT:**
> [Sends detailed brief with all 10 books, visual direction, keywords, comp authors]

**YOU:**
> This is exceptional work — you've given me a complete roadmap for all 10 books. Here's my plan:
>
> **Design System:**
> - [Palette, typography, recurring motif, visual progression across 10 books]
>
> **Cover Plan:**
> - Books 1-3: [Arc 1 visual theme]
> - Books 4-6: [Arc 2 visual theme / shift]
> - Books 7-9: [Arc 3 visual theme / escalation]
> - Book 10: [Climactic visual — distinct but unified]
>
> **Series Logo:** [Description]
>
> **Box Set Cover:** [Description — how it represents all 10 books]
>
> **Description Strategy:**
> - Voice: [Genre-matched tone]
> - Structure: Hook → character → stakes → escalation → CTA
> - Keywords distributed naturally across all 10 descriptions
> - Comp authors referenced in Books 1 and 5 (entry points for new readers)
> - Each description stands alone (reader can start at Book 1 or discover mid-series)
> - Spoiler discipline: Each description only references events from prior books, never ahead
>
> I'll deliver everything within 4 business days. Starting now!

---

### Scenario B: Partial Brief (5 Books Detailed, 5 Rough)

**CLIENT:**
> Books 1-5 are solid. Books 6-10 are rough — just titles and general ideas.

**YOU:**
> That's plenty. For Books 1-5, I have everything I need for strong covers and targeted descriptions.
>
> For Books 6-10, I'll:
> - **Covers:** Design within the established visual system, using your rough ideas for the key visual. The palette, typography, and composition logic carry forward automatically.
> - **Descriptions:** Write genre-appropriate hooks based on your rough ideas. They'll be more general than Books 1-5 but still keyword-rich and conversion-focused.
>
> As Books 6-10 solidify, you can update:
> - Cover title change: $35 (Cover Minor Revision)
> - Cover visual overhaul: $100 (Cover Major Revision)
> - Description rewrite: $35 (Book Description Update)
>
> I'll start building everything now and you can refine later. Sound good?

---

### Scenario C: Client Sends Brief in Multiple Messages Over Days

**CLIENT:**
> [Sends Books 1-3 on Monday, Books 4-7 on Wednesday, Books 8-10 on Friday]

**YOU (after receiving Books 1-3):**
> Got Books 1-3 — great detail. I'll start building the design system and these first covers while you prepare the rest. Take your time on Books 4-10.

**YOU (after receiving all 10):**
> Perfect — I now have all 10 books. I'll integrate Books 4-10 into the design system I started building from Books 1-3. Everything will be cohesive.
>
> Full delivery in 4 business days from today. Starting full production now!

---

## Phase 4: Deliverables Delivery

**YOU:**

> > [Ends with series hook: "Book 1 of [Series Name]"]

> > [Full description — continues from Book 1 without spoiling key reveals]
>
> [... through Book 10]
>
> **Book 10 — "[Title]"**
> > [Full description — finale hook, "The epic conclusion of [Series Name]"]
> > [CTA: "Start from Book 1: [Link]"]
>
> ---

> - Palette: [Colors used, how they evolve]

> - Progression: [How covers evolve from Book 1 to Book 10]
>
> **Description Notes:**

> - Comp authors referenced: [Where and how]
> - Spoiler discipline: [How each description respects prior-book boundaries]
>
> ---
>
> **What to do next:**
> 1. Review all 22 deliverables (10 covers + logo + box set + 10 descriptions)
> 2. **Covers:** Check visual consistency, titles, author name, thumbnail readability. View all 10 side by side.
> 3. **Descriptions:** Check accuracy, tone, keywords, spoiler boundaries, and hooks. Read each as if you're a reader who's never heard of the series.
> 4. List ALL changes in one message — Revision Round 1 of 2
>
> Take your time. This is a big delivery and it's worth reviewing carefully.

---

## Phase 5: Revision Round 1

### Scenario A: Scattered Feedback Across Covers and Descriptions

**CLIENT:**
> Overall this is incredible. Here are my notes:
>
> Covers:
> - Book 4: Needs a darker mood — this is the "everything falls apart" book
> - Book 7: Character should be more prominent
> - Book 10: The title text is hard to read against the background
>
> Descriptions:
> - Book 1: Perfect
> - Book 3: Add "slow burn romance" as a keyword — that's a big search term for my genre
> - Book 5: The hook is too similar to Book 4's — differentiate them
> - Book 8: Too many spoilers from Book 7. Dial back.
> - Book 9: The ending CTA should reference the finale (Book 10), not just "continue the series"
> - All others: Perfect

**YOU:**
> Clear notes — I'll address all 8 items:
>
> **Covers:**
> 1. Book 4 — Darken the mood: deeper shadows, more desaturated palette, heavier atmosphere
> 2. Book 7 — Scale up the character: more prominent in the composition, closer framing
> 3. Book 10 — Improve title readability: add contrast backing, adjust text color or add subtle glow
>
> **Descriptions:**
> 4. Book 3 — Weave "slow burn romance" naturally into the relationship setup
> 5. Book 5 — Differentiate from Book 4: new opening hook, different emotional angle
> 6. Book 8 — Pull back Book 7 references. Set up Book 8's unique conflict without revealing Book 7's resolution.
> 7. Book 9 — Update CTA to tease the finale: "The epic conclusion awaits in [Book 10 Title]"
>
> Revision Round 1 of 2. All updates delivered together.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants Major Changes to a Section of Covers

**CLIENT:**
> Books 1-4 and 8-10 are great. But Books 5, 6, and 7 need different visual approaches — they're the "middle arc" and should feel distinct.

**YOU:**
> I can create new directions for Books 5-7 in Revision Round 1. To make the most of it:
>
> For each book, tell me:
> - What's not working in the current version?
> - What should the "middle arc" feel like? (Darker? Different setting? Different color temperature? More intimate vs epic?)
>
> The more specific you are, the closer I'll land in one pass. Round 2 is still available for fine-tuning after this.

---

### Scenario C: Client Wants All Descriptions Restructured

**CLIENT:**
> The covers are perfect but the descriptions need a different structure. Instead of action hooks, I want each one to open with an emotional question.

**YOU:**
> I'll restructure all 10 descriptions to lead with emotional questions:
>
> - Book 1: "What would you sacrifice for the truth?"
> - Book 2: "How far would you follow someone you can't trust?"
> - [etc. — each one unique, genre-appropriate, emotionally resonant]
>
> Same keywords, same genre positioning, same spoiler discipline — just a different structural approach.
>
> This uses Revision Round 1. Round 2 available for further fine-tuning.

---

## Phase 6: Revision Round 2

### Scenario A: Final Polish

**CLIENT:**
> Round 1 is great. Just a few tiny things:
> - Book 6 cover: The sky color is slightly off from the rest of the arc — can you match it?
> - Book 9 description: Change "ancient war" to "forgotten war" — fits the lore better
> - That's it!

**YOU:**
> Easy fixes:
> 1. Book 6 — Color-match the sky to the rest of the middle arc palette
> 2. Book 9 description — "ancient war" → "forgotten war"
>
> Round 2 of 2. I'll apply these plus a final quality pass across all 22 deliverables and prepare your files.

---

### Scenario B: Client Happy After Round 1

**CLIENT:**
> Round 1 fixed everything. Let's finalize!

**YOU:**
> I'll do a final quality pass — color consistency across all 10 covers, typography alignment check, description formatting verification — and prepare your complete delivery package. Round 2 stays available if you spot anything after receiving finals.

---

## Phase 7: Final Delivery

**YOU:**
> Hi [Client]! Your complete 10-book Full Pipeline package is finalized.
>
> **Final Delivery — [Series Name] (10 Books)**
>
> **Covers (PNG + JPG, 1600x2400, 300 DPI each):**
> - `[Book-1-Title]-Cover-FINAL.png / .jpg`
> - `[Book-2-Title]-Cover-FINAL.png / .jpg`
> - ... [through Book 10]
>
> **Series Logo:**
> - `[Series]-Logo.png` (transparent background)
> - `[Series]-Logo-Dark.png` (for light backgrounds)
>
> **Box Set Cover:**
> - `[Series]-BoxSet-FINAL.png / .jpg`
>
> **Amazon Book Descriptions:**
> - `Book-Descriptions.docx` — All 10 descriptions with HTML-formatted and plain text versions
> - `Keywords-Reference.txt` — Master list of all keywords used across descriptions (useful for your Amazon backend keyword fields)
>
> **Files delivered via:** Google Drive link (organized: /Covers, /Logo, /BoxSet, /Descriptions)
>
> **Publishing checklist:**
> 1. Upload covers to KDP (Kindle + Print front covers)
> 2. Copy descriptions to each book's KDP listing (use HTML versions for best formatting)
> 3. Use logo on your Amazon author page and marketing materials
> 4. Upload box set cover for your Amazon box set listing
> 5. View all 10 covers side by side at thumbnail size before going live
> 6. Read each description one final time before publishing
>
> **Important — I recommend a soft launch:**
> Publish Books 1-3 first. Monitor reviews and sales data. Then release the remaining books on a cadence that builds momentum (weekly or biweekly releases work well for Amazon's algorithm).
>
> This has been an extraordinary project. A 10-book series with full visual and verbal identity is a serious accomplishment. A Reedsy review would mean the world to me — and returning clients always get 10% off!

---

## Phase 8: Post-Delivery Scenarios

### Scenario A: Client Wants to Extend to 12+ Books

**CLIENT:**
> The series is expanding to 12 books. Need covers and descriptions for 2 more.

**YOU:**
> Since the visual and verbal system is fully established:
>
> - 2x Add New Book Cover: $125 each = $250
> - 2x Book Description: $35 each = $70
> - Total: $320
>
> Returning client discount (10%): **$288**
>
> I just need titles, brief plot summaries, and key visual elements. 1-2 business day delivery.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants Multiple Box Set Configurations

**CLIENT:**
> I want box sets for: Books 1-3, Books 4-6, Books 7-10, and the complete 10-book set.

**YOU:**
> Your package includes 1 box set cover (the complete 10-book set — already delivered).
>
> The 3 additional partial box set covers: $100 each = $300.
> Returning client discount: **$270**.
>
> - Box Set 1: Books 1-3
> - Box Set 2: Books 4-6
> - Box Set 3: Books 7-10
> - Box Set 4: Complete (already delivered)
>
> All designed within the existing visual system. 1 business day per box set.

---

### Scenario C: Client Wants Description A/B Testing

**CLIENT:**
> Book 1 isn't converting well. Can you write an alternative description so I can A/B test?

**YOU:**
> Smart approach. I'll write an alternative Book 1 description with:
> - Different opening hook (emotional vs action, or vice versa)
> - Different structure (question-led vs statement-led)
> - Same keywords, different emphasis
>
> Book Description Update: $35. Returning client: **$31.50**.
>
> You'll then have two versions to rotate on Amazon and track which converts better.

---

### Scenario D: Client Returns 6 Months Later for a New Series

**CLIENT:**
> That series did great! I'm starting a new 5-book series. Can you do the full pipeline again?

**YOU:**
> I'd love to! Since you're a returning client:
>
> Full Pipeline Standard (5 Books): $850.
> Returning client discount (10%): **$765**.
>
> If there's any connection between the two series (shared universe, crossover characters), I can design the new series to complement the existing one visually while having its own distinct identity.
>
> Send me the new brief whenever you're ready!

---

### Scenario E: Client Asks About Marketing Beyond Amazon

**CLIENT:**
> I want to promote the series on social media. Can you create promotional graphics?

**YOU:**
> Promotional graphics aren't part of the Pipeline package, but I can create them as custom work. Common requests:
>
> - **Social media announcement graphics** (square + story formats)
> - **Series overview banner** (landscape format for Facebook/Twitter headers)
> - **Quote graphics** (book quotes over cover art)
> - **Release countdown graphics**
>
> Contact me at hello@metronagon.com and I'll put together a custom quote based on what you need. As a returning client, you'll get 10% off.

## Follow-Up Template (If Client Goes Silent)

After 4 days:

**YOU:**
> Hi [Client]! Just checking in — I know 22 deliverables is a lot to review. Take your time, but I wanted to make sure everything came through correctly. Your revision rounds are still active whenever you're ready. Let me know if you have any questions!

After 10 days:

**YOU:**
> Hi [Client] — following up once more. All your files are saved and both revision rounds are still available. Whenever you're ready to send feedback, I'll jump right on it. If your timeline has shifted, no problem at all — just let me know and we'll work around your schedule.
