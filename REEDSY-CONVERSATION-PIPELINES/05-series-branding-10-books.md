**Package:** Series Branding — Premium (10 Books)
**Price:** $950
**Delivery:** 3 business days
**Revisions:** 2 rounds included
**Deliverables:** 10 visually consistent front covers, series logo, box set front cover

---

## Phase 1: Initial Inquiry

### Scenario A: Client Has a Large Series Planned

**CLIENT:**

> Hi, I'm writing a 10-book sci-fi series and I need covers for all of them. What's your biggest series package?

**YOU:**

> Hi! A 10-book series is a serious project — I've done exactly this myself with my 12-book Aztec Samurai Adventures series on Amazon, so I know what it takes to maintain visual consistency across that many books.
>
> My Series Branding — Premium package is $950 for 10 books:
>
> - 10 visually consistent front covers (Kindle + paperback ready, 1600x2400, 300 DPI)
> - Series logo (logomark + wordmark)
> - Box set front cover
> - 2 rounds of revisions on any deliverable
> - 3 business day delivery
>
> That's $95 per cover — the best per-unit value across all my packages. Plus the logo and box set are included.
>
> Every cover is built on a unified design system — same palette, typography hierarchy, composition logic — so all 10 books read as a cohesive series on Amazon.
>
> Want to move forward? I'll send the creative brief.

---

### Scenario B: Client Considering 5-Book vs 10-Book Package

**CLIENT:**

> I have 10 books planned but only 5 are written. Should I do the 5-book package now and add the rest later?

**YOU:**

> If you're confident it will be 10 books, the Premium package at $950 is significantly better value:
>
> **5-book now ($600) + 5 individual covers later ($125 each = $625) = $1,225 total**
> vs.
> **10-book package: $950 total**
>
> That's a $275 savings. Plus:
>
> - All 10 covers designed as a single unified system — maximum visual consistency
> - Box set cover reflects the full 10-book series from day one
> - 2 revision rounds instead of 1
>
> For the 5 unwritten books, I just need working titles and a rough sense of each book's focus (even one sentence). If titles change later, text updates are $35 each (Cover Minor Revision).
>
> The design system (palette, typography, composition logic, logo) is locked from the start, so even if book details evolve, the visual consistency holds.

---

### Scenario C: Client Asks About Partial Delivery

**CLIENT:**

> Can you deliver the first 3-4 covers first so I can start publishing while you work on the rest?

**YOU:**

> I design all 10 together as a batch to ensure maximum consistency, but I can deliver in stages if that helps your publishing timeline:
>
> - **Stage 1 (Day 2):** Covers 1-4 + series logo — enough to start publishing
> - **Stage 2 (Day 3):** Covers 5-10 + box set cover — remaining deliverables
>
> This way you have your first books ready to list while the full set is being completed. The logo comes in Stage 1 so you can use it on your Amazon author page and marketing immediately.
>
> The revision rounds apply to everything — you can hold feedback until you've seen all 10, or give feedback on Stage 1 while I'm working on Stage 2.
>
> Want to proceed with this staged approach?

---

## AI Transparency & Client Consent (Reedsy Compliance — Required)

> **This disclosure must be sent BEFORE proceeding to the creative brief. Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, you must obtain the client's written consent before any AI-assisted tools are used in the project.**

After the client expresses interest and before sending the creative brief, send the following:

**YOU:**

> Before we move forward, I want to be fully transparent about my creative process — I share this with every client upfront, and Reedsy requires it.
>
> My design workflow uses **AI-assisted image generation** as a core part of the creative pipeline. I use advanced prompt engineering techniques to generate high-quality visual concepts, which I then refine, composite, color-grade, and finalize into production-ready cover art and visual assets.
>
> **What this means in practice:**
>
> - I translate your creative brief into detailed, genre-specific image generation prompts — each one carefully engineered to capture your series' characters, setting, mood, and genre conventions
> - Each concept goes through multiple rounds of generation, selection, and refinement — I generate dozens of variations and curate the strongest results
> - I composite, color-grade, and enhance the selected outputs to achieve a cohesive, polished visual system across all covers in your series
> - Typography, layout, logo design, and final production are handled with professional design precision
> - Every deliverable — covers, series logo, and box set cover — is a polished, commercially ready, print-quality product
>
> **What this does NOT mean:**
>
> - This is not "type a sentence and use the first thing that appears." Every visual goes through an extensive creative process driven by my expertise in book cover design, genre conventions, and Amazon marketplace requirements.
> - I've published 22 books across 3 series on Amazon — all designed using this exact pipeline. Maintaining visual consistency across a 10-book series is where this process truly shines.
>
> **Please take a look at my portfolio to see the quality this process delivers:**
>
> - https://metronagon.com/examples — cover gallery across multiple genres
> - https://metronagon.com/case-studies — complete series case studies showing visual consistency across multiple books
>
> Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, I need your written confirmation that you're comfortable with AI-assisted tools being part of the creative process before we proceed.
>
> Happy to answer any questions about how it works.

### Client Response: Accepts

**CLIENT:**

> That's totally fine with me. Your portfolio looks great — let's go!

**YOU:**

> Thank you — I appreciate both the trust and the chance to work on this. I'll note your consent in our project record and send you the creative brief next.

---

### Client Response: Has Questions About Quality / Uniqueness

**CLIENT:**

> I'm open to it, but I want to make sure my covers won't look "AI-generated" or generic. How do you ensure quality across 10 books?

**YOU:**

> Completely fair concern, and one I take seriously. Here's how I deliver professional-grade results:
>
> 1. **Your brief drives every prompt.** I don't use templates or generic inputs. Every image generation prompt is custom-built from YOUR specific characters, settings, mood, color palette, and genre.
> 2. **Iterative refinement.** I generate dozens of variations per concept, then select, composite, and refine the strongest elements — it's a curation and design process, not a one-shot output.
> 3. **Series consistency at scale.** This is where my process excels — I engineer prompts that maintain the same visual language, color palette, and compositional logic across all 10 books while giving each cover its own identity.
> 4. **Professional finishing.** Typography, composition, color grading, and production polish are all applied with the same rigor as any professional design workflow.
> 5. **Genre expertise.** I know what works on Amazon because I sell there myself. Your covers will look like they belong on a bestseller shelf.
>
> Check my case studies for proof: https://metronagon.com/case-studies — you'll see complete series with consistent visual identity across multiple books. That level of design intention doesn't happen by accident.
>
> If you're comfortable, just confirm and I'll send the creative brief!

---

### Client Response: Has Copyright Concerns

**CLIENT:**

> I've read that AI-generated images can't be copyrighted. Will that be a problem for my covers?

**YOU:**

> Important question — and one I take very seriously as a professional.
>
> You're right that the US Copyright Office has indicated that purely AI-generated images with minimal human input may lack full copyright protection on their own. However, my workflow involves substantial human creative direction at every stage: concept development, detailed prompt engineering, visual selection, compositing, refinement, typography, layout, and production design.
>
> The final products you receive are not raw AI outputs — they're professionally designed covers that reflect significant human creative decision-making throughout the entire process.
>
> As a Reedsy professional, I bear full legal responsibility for ensuring that your deliverables are commercially exploitable and free of copyright issues. That's my obligation to you, and I stand behind it completely.
>
> You'll receive production-ready files that you can use commercially on Amazon, IngramSpark, or any other publishing platform without restriction.

---

### Client Response: Declines AI-Assisted Work

**CLIENT:**

> I appreciate the honesty, but I'd prefer a designer who works without AI tools. Nothing personal.

**YOU:**

> No offense taken at all — I genuinely respect that preference, and I'd always rather be upfront than surprise you later.
>
> I'd suggest browsing Reedsy's other designers who specialize in hand-illustrated or traditional digital painting approaches. If you ever want to see what my pipeline can deliver, my portfolio is always open: https://metronagon.com/examples
>
> Best of luck with your series!

---

## Phase 2: Creative Brief Request

**YOU:**

> Here's the creative brief for your 10-book series. This is a larger brief than my smaller packages, but the detail matters — with 10 books, the visual system needs to be rock-solid from day one.
>
> **CREATIVE BRIEF — Series Branding (10 Books)**
>
> **1. Series Overview**
>
> - Series name (if you have one):
> - Genre:
> - Brief series description (4-5 sentences about the overall story arc):
> - Target audience — Who is your ideal reader?
> - Total number of books planned (if more than 10):
>
> **2. Individual Book Details (for each of the 10 books)**
>
> For each book, provide:
>
> - Title (and subtitle, if any):
> - Brief description (2-3 sentences — what happens in this book?):
> - Key visual element or scene — What should this cover convey?
> - Emotional position (e.g., "darkest book," "the turning point," "triumphant finale"):
>
> _Book 1:_ ...
> _Book 2:_ ...
> _Book 3:_ ...
> _Book 4:_ ...
> _Book 5:_ ...
> _Book 6:_ ...
> _Book 7:_ ...
> _Book 8:_ ...
> _Book 9:_ ...
> _Book 10:_ ...
>
> **3. Visual Direction (for the whole series)**
>
> - Mood/tone — What feeling should the series evoke?
> - Color palette preferences — Colors you love or want to avoid:
> - Style preference — Photorealistic or stylized?
> - Key recurring visual element — Object, symbol, or motif tying the series together:
> - Visual progression — Should covers evolve across the series? (e.g., darker over time, escalating scale, shifting color temperature)
>
> **4. Reference Covers**
>
> - 3-5 existing book covers or series you admire — especially long series with consistent branding:
> - Covers you DON'T like — styles or looks to avoid:
>
> **5. Logo and Typography**
>
> - Series logo direction — Any ideas, or "your call"?
> - Author name (exactly as it should appear on all covers):
> - Font style preference — Serif, sans-serif, script, display? Or "your call":
>
> **6. Publishing Platform**
>
> - Where will this be published? (Amazon Kindle, KDP Print Paperback, or KDP Print Hardcover?):
>
> **Tip:** If you don't have full details for all 10 books, give me what you have. For the rest, even a working title + one sentence about the mood or setting is enough. I can design a cover that fits the series system and refine it later.

## Phase 3: Receiving the Brief

### Scenario A: Complete Brief (All 10 Books Detailed)

**CLIENT:**

> [Sends complete brief with all 10 books detailed, references, visual direction, etc.]

**YOU:**

> This is an outstanding brief — you've given me everything I need for all 10 books. Here's my design plan:
>
> **Design System:**
>
> - [Describe unified palette, recurring motifs, typography system]
> - [Describe visual progression across the 10 books]
> - [Describe composition approach — how covers will vary while staying cohesive]
>
> **Cover Plan (brief summary for each):**
>
> - **Book 1:** [Key visual, mood, composition note]
> - **Book 2:** [Key visual, mood, composition note]
> - ... [through Book 10]
>
> **Series Logo:** [Description of logo concept]
>
> **Box Set Cover:** [Description of how it represents the full series]
>
> I'll deliver all 12 pieces (10 covers + logo + box set) within 3 business days. Starting now!

---

### Scenario B: Partial Brief (Only Some Books Detailed)

**CLIENT:**

> I have detailed info for Books 1-6 but Books 7-10 are still rough outlines. Here's what I have...

**YOU:**

> This is plenty to start. For Books 1-6 I have everything I need.
>
> For Books 7-10, I'll work from your rough outlines and design covers that:
>
> - Fit the visual system established by Books 1-6
> - Match the emotional progression of the series (escalating intensity toward the finale)
> - Use compositional variety so they don't feel repetitive
>
> When your plans for Books 7-10 solidify, any title changes or visual adjustments are just $35 per cover (Cover Minor Revision) or $100 for a completely new direction (Cover Major Revision).
>
> Let me work with what you've given me — I'll make creative decisions for the gaps and you can refine during your 2 revision rounds. Sound good?

---

### Scenario C: Client Overwhelmed by Brief Size

**CLIENT:**

> This is a lot of questions. Can I just send you a general description and let you handle the details?

**YOU:**

> Absolutely. For a 10-book series, here's the minimum I need:
>
> 1. **Series name and genre**
> 2. **2-3 sentence series description** (what's the overall story about?)
> 3. **10 book titles** (even working titles)
> 4. **One sentence per book** (what's this book's focus or mood?)
> 5. **3 reference covers** you like (Amazon links)
> 6. **Author name** as it should appear on the covers
>
> That's it. I'll handle the palette, typography, composition, logo design, and visual progression. You'll see everything in the first delivery and can steer from there using your 2 revision rounds.
>
> Send me those 6 things and I'll get started.

---

## Phase 4: Deliverables Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi [Client]! Your complete 10-book Series Branding package is ready. This is a big delivery — here's everything:
>
> **Covers (10):**
>
> [For each book, include:] > **Book [N] — "[Title]"** > [Image attached] > [1-2 sentence description of the visual, mood, and how it fits the series progression]
>
> **Series Logo — "[Series Name]"** > [Image attached] > [Brief description of the logo design and how it connects to the series identity]
>
> **Box Set Front Cover** > [Image attached] > [Description of how the box set represents the full 10-book collection]
>
> **Design System Notes:**
>
> - Palette: [Colors used across the series]
> - Typography: [Font family, hierarchy]
> - Recurring motif: [Visual element that ties covers together]
> - Progression: [How covers evolve from Book 1 to Book 10]
>
> **What to do next:**
>
> 1. Review all 12 deliverables — take your time with this, there's a lot to look at
> 2. Compile ALL feedback into one message — note which cover numbers need changes and what specifically
> 3. This is Revision Round 1 of 2 — I'll address everything in a single pass
>
> **Tip:** View all 10 covers side by side to check visual consistency. Also shrink each to thumbnail size to see how they'll look on Amazon search results.

---

## Phase 5: Revision Round 1

### Scenario A: Scattered Changes Across Multiple Covers

**CLIENT:**

> Overall these are amazing. Here are my notes:
>
> - Book 2: Lighten the background slightly
> - Book 5: The character should be facing left instead of right
> - Book 7: Can the sky be more dramatic? More clouds, more color.
> - Book 9: The title text is hard to read — needs more contrast
> - Logo: Perfect
> - Box set: Can you make Book 1's element more prominent?
> - Everything else is perfect

**YOU:**

> Great notes — all very doable. I'll address all 5 changes:
>
> 1. Book 2 — Lighten background for more contrast
> 2. Book 5 — Flip character orientation to face left
> 3. Book 7 — Dramatic sky: more clouds, richer color gradient
> 4. Book 9 — Increase title text contrast against background
> 5. Box set — Make Book 1's visual element more prominent in the composition
>
> This is Revision Round 1 of 2. I'll deliver all updates together. You'll still have Round 2 for any final fine-tuning.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants Several Covers Completely Rethought

**CLIENT:**

> Books 1-4 and 8-10 are great. But Books 5, 6, and 7 don't feel right — they need different approaches.

**YOU:**

> I can rework 3 covers in Revision Round 1. To make the most of it, please tell me for each:
>
> - **Book 5:** What's not working? What should it be instead?
> - **Book 6:** What's not working? What should it be instead?
> - **Book 7:** What's not working? What should it be instead?
>
> The more specific you are, the closer I'll get in one pass. You'll still have Round 2 for any fine-tuning on these or any other covers.
>
> If the reworks are extensive and you'd like additional covers fully redesigned beyond what the 2 revision rounds cover, individual Cover Major Revisions are available at $100 per cover.

---

## Phase 6: Revision Round 2

### Scenario A: Final Fine-Tuning

**CLIENT:**

> Round 1 fixes look great. Just two small things:
>
> - Book 5 (revised): Love the new direction but the character's hair color should be darker
> - Book 9 (revised): Text looks better but can the font be just slightly larger?

**YOU:**

> Easy fixes. I'll handle both and do a final polish pass on all 10 covers — color correction, typography sharpening, composition tightening — before preparing your delivery files.
>
> This is Round 2 of 2 (your final included round). After this, I'll send the complete final delivery package.

---

### Scenario B: Client Happy After Round 1

**CLIENT:**

> Round 1 looks perfect. I don't need Round 2. Let's finalize!

**YOU:**

> Excellent! I'll do a final polish pass on all 12 deliverables and prepare your files. Your unused Round 2 doesn't expire — if you spot anything after receiving final files, it's still available.

---

## Phase 7: Final Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi [Client]! Your complete 10-book Series Branding package is finalized. Here's your full delivery:
>
> **Covers (PNG + JPG, 1600x2400, 300 DPI each):**
>
> - `[Book-1-Title]-Cover-FINAL.png / .jpg`
> - `[Book-2-Title]-Cover-FINAL.png / .jpg`
> - ... [through Book 10]
>
> **Series Logo:**
>
> - `[Series-Name]-Logo.png` (transparent background)
> - `[Series-Name]-Logo-Dark.png` (for light backgrounds)
>
> **Box Set Cover:**
>
> - `[Series-Name]-BoxSet-FINAL.png / .jpg` (1600x2400, 300 DPI)
>
> **Files delivered via:** Google Drive link (organized in folders: /Covers, /Logo, /BoxSet)
>
> **Usage:**
>
> - **Kindle:** Upload each cover as the ebook cover in KDP
> - **KDP Print:** Upload each as the front cover, use Amazon's Cover Creator for spine and back
> - **Box Set:** Upload for Amazon box set listing
> - **Logo:** Amazon author page, social media, website, marketing
>
> **Important:** View all 10 covers side by side before publishing. Check:
>
> - All titles spelled correctly
> - Author name consistent on every cover
> - Visual consistency holds at both full size and thumbnail size
> - Logo placement is uniform
>
> This has been an incredible project. A 10-book series is a major undertaking and your series deserves to look this good on Amazon. A Reedsy review would mean the world to me — and returning clients always get 10% off!

---

## Phase 8: Post-Delivery Scenarios

### Scenario A: Client Wants to Extend Beyond 10 Books

**CLIENT:**

> The series is expanding — I need covers for Books 11 and 12.

**YOU:**

> Congratulations on the expansion! Since the visual system is fully established, adding new covers is straightforward.
>
> Additional books beyond the 10-book bundle are $125 per cover (Add New Book Cover). Each will be designed to match the existing series system perfectly.
>
> 2 covers x $125 = $250. I just need the title and a brief description for each. 1 business day delivery per cover.
>
> Want me to send the brief?

---

### Scenario B: Client Needs Multiple Box Set Covers

**CLIENT:**

> I want to release 3 box sets: Books 1-3, Books 4-7, and the complete set. Can you make all 3?

**YOU:**

> Your package included 1 box set cover (the complete set). The 2 additional partial box set covers would each be a New Box Set Front Cover at $100 each = $200 total.
>
> - Box Set 1: Books 1-3
> - Box Set 2: Books 4-7
> - Box Set 3: Complete set (already delivered)
>
> I'll design all partial box sets to match the series visual system. 1 business day each.
>
> Want me to go ahead?

---

### Scenario C: Client Returns Months Later for Updates

**CLIENT:**

> Hey, it's been 6 months. Book 3's title changed and I need the cover updated. Also, can you update the box set cover to reflect the new title?

**YOU:**

> Welcome back! I have all your files on record. Two updates:
>
> 1. **Book 3 title change** — Cover Minor Revision: $35
> 2. **Box set cover update** — New Box Set Front Cover: $100
>
> Total: $135. Both ready within 1 business day.
>
> As a returning client, you get 10% off: **$121.50 total.**
>
> Want me to proceed? Just send me the new title.
