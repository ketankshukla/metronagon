## Phase 1: Initial Inquiry (Client Messages You First)

### Scenario A: Client Asks About Premium vs Standard

**CLIENT:**

> Hi, I see you have a Standard and Premium cover option. What's the difference?

**YOU:**

> Great question! Here's the breakdown:
>
> **Standard ($450):**
>
> - 2 concept variations
> - 1 polished final
> - 1 revision round
> - 3–5 business day delivery
>
> **Premium ($650):**
>
> - 3 concept variations — more visual directions to choose from
> - Premium cinematic photorealistic style — the same system I used for my published 22-book Amazon portfolio
> - Extended refinement on the final — multiple creative passes, meticulous typography
> - 2 revision rounds — twice the opportunity to fine-tune
> - 2 business day delivery
>
> The Premium is my recommended option if your book is a flagship title, the start of a series, or if you want the strongest possible shelf presence. The extra concept and revision round make a real difference.
>
> What's your book about? I can recommend which fits best.

---

### Scenario B: Client Comes in Wanting Premium

**CLIENT:**

> Hi, I'm interested in the Premium cover package. I'm launching a thriller series and the first cover needs to be strong.

**YOU:**

> Smart thinking — the first cover sets the tone for the entire series, so Premium is exactly the right call.
>
> For $650 you get:
>
> - 3 distinct concept variations — I'll give you three fully realized visual directions so you have maximum choice
> - Premium cinematic style with custom visual direction — this is the same pipeline I used across all 22 of my published Amazon titles
> - Extended refinement on the final — multiple creative passes with meticulous typography
> - 2 full revision rounds to fine-tune everything
> - 2 business day delivery
>
> For thriller covers specifically, I focus on high-contrast compositions, tension-building imagery, and typography that reads instantly at thumbnail size.
>
> Want to move forward? I'll send you the creative brief.

---

### Scenario C: Client on a Budget Asks if Standard Is "Good Enough"

**CLIENT:**

> I want a great cover but I'm on a tight budget. Is the Standard package good enough or will I regret not going Premium?

**YOU:**

> Honest answer: the Standard package delivers a professional, Amazon-ready cover. You won't get a lesser quality image — both tiers use the same creative pipeline and the same output specs (1600x2400, 300 DPI).
>
> The difference is in **options and polish:**
>
> - Standard gives you 2 concepts and 1 revision. You'll get a great cover.
> - Premium gives you 3 concepts and 2 revisions. You'll get more choices and more room to perfect it.
>
> If you know exactly what you want and can give me a detailed brief, Standard works great. If you're less sure about the visual direction and want to explore, Premium gives you that extra breathing room.
>
> Either way, you're getting a professional cover. Go with what fits your budget.

---

## AI Transparency & Client Consent (Reedsy Compliance — Required)

> **This disclosure must be sent BEFORE proceeding to the creative brief. Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, you must obtain the client's written consent before any AI-assisted tools are used in the project.**

After the client expresses interest and before sending the creative brief, send the following:

**YOU:**

> Before we move forward, I want to be fully transparent about my creative process — I share this with every client upfront, and Reedsy requires it.
>
> My design workflow uses **AI-assisted image generation** as a core part of the creative pipeline. I use advanced prompt engineering techniques to generate high-quality visual concepts, which I then refine, composite, color-grade, and finalize into production-ready cover art.
>
> **What this means in practice:**
>
> - I translate your creative brief into detailed, genre-specific image generation prompts — each one carefully engineered to capture your book's characters, setting, mood, and genre conventions
> - Each concept goes through multiple rounds of generation, selection, and refinement — I generate dozens of variations and curate the strongest results
> - I composite, color-grade, and enhance the selected outputs to achieve a cohesive, polished visual
> - Typography, layout, and final production are handled with professional design precision
> - The final deliverable is a polished, commercially ready, print-quality product — not a raw AI output
>
> **What this does NOT mean:**
>
> - This is not "type a sentence and use the first thing that appears." Every cover goes through an extensive creative process driven by my expertise in book cover design, genre conventions, and Amazon marketplace requirements.
> - I've published 22 books across 3 series on Amazon — all designed using this exact pipeline. The results speak for themselves.
>
> **Please take a look at my portfolio to see the quality this process delivers:**
>
> - https://metronagon.com/ai-transparency — full details on my AI-assisted process, copyright protections, and a real example prompt
> - https://metronagon.com/examples — cover gallery across multiple genres
> - https://metronagon.com/case-studies — complete series case studies showing visual consistency across multiple books
>
> Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, I need your written confirmation that you're comfortable with AI-assisted tools being part of the creative process before we proceed.
>
> Happy to answer any questions about how it works.

### Client Response: Accepts

**CLIENT:**

> That's totally fine with me. Your portfolio looks great — let's go!

**YOU:**

> Thank you — I appreciate both the trust and the chance to work on this. I'll note your consent in our project record and send you the creative brief next.

---

### Client Response: Has Questions About Quality / Uniqueness

**CLIENT:**

> I'm open to it, but I want to make sure my cover won't look "AI-generated" or generic. How do you ensure quality?

**YOU:**

> Completely fair concern, and one I take seriously. Here's how I deliver professional-grade results:
>
> 1. **Your brief drives every prompt.** I don't use templates or generic inputs. Every image generation prompt is custom-built from YOUR specific characters, settings, mood, color palette, and genre.
> 2. **Iterative refinement.** I generate dozens of variations per concept, then select, composite, and refine the strongest elements — it's a curation and design process, not a one-shot output.
> 3. **Professional finishing.** Typography, composition, color grading, and production polish are all applied with the same rigor as any professional design workflow.
> 4. **Genre expertise.** I know what works on Amazon because I sell there myself. Your cover will look like it belongs on a bestseller shelf, not on an AI demo page.
>
> Check my case studies for proof: https://metronagon.com/case-studies — you'll see complete series with consistent visual identity across multiple books. That level of design intention doesn't happen by accident.
>
> If you're comfortable, just confirm and I'll send the creative brief!

---

### Client Response: Has Copyright Concerns

**CLIENT:**

> I've read that AI-generated images can't be copyrighted. Will that be a problem for my cover?

**YOU:**

> Important question — and one I take very seriously as a professional.
>
> You're right that the US Copyright Office has indicated that purely AI-generated images with minimal human input may lack full copyright protection on their own. However, my workflow involves substantial human creative direction at every stage: concept development, detailed prompt engineering, visual selection, compositing, refinement, typography, layout, and production design.
>
> The final product you receive is not a raw AI output — it's a professionally designed cover that reflects significant human creative decision-making throughout the entire process.
>
> As a Reedsy professional, I bear full legal responsibility for ensuring that your deliverables are commercially exploitable and free of copyright issues. That's my obligation to you, and I stand behind it completely.
>
> You'll receive production-ready files that you can use commercially on Amazon, IngramSpark, or any other publishing platform without restriction.

---

### Client Response: Declines AI-Assisted Work

**CLIENT:**

> I appreciate the honesty, but I'd prefer a designer who works without AI tools. Nothing personal.

**YOU:**

> No offense taken at all — I genuinely respect that preference, and I'd always rather be upfront than surprise you later.
>
> I'd suggest browsing Reedsy's other designers who specialize in hand-illustrated or traditional digital painting approaches. If you ever want to see what my pipeline can deliver, my portfolio is always open: https://metronagon.com/examples
>
> Best of luck with your book!

---

## Phase 2: Creative Brief Request

Once the client confirms Premium:

**YOU:**

> Let's do it! Here's the creative brief for the Premium package. The more detail you provide, the stronger all 3 concepts will be.
>
> **CREATIVE BRIEF — Front Cover Design (Premium)**
>
> **1. Book Details**
>
> - Book title (and subtitle, if any):
> - Author name (exactly as it should appear on the cover):
> - Genre (e.g., thriller, romance, sci-fi, fantasy, literary fiction):
> - Brief book description (2-3 sentences):
> - Target audience — Who is your ideal reader?
>
> **2. Visual Direction**
>
> - Mood/tone — What feeling should the cover evoke?
> - Key visual elements — Specific objects, scenes, or symbols:
> - Color preferences — Colors you love or want to avoid:
> - Specific scene or moment from the book you'd love captured:
>
> **3. Reference Covers**
>
> - 3-5 existing book covers you admire (Amazon links or screenshots):
> - Covers you DON'T like — styles or looks to avoid:
>
> **4. Typography**
>
> - Font style preference — Serif, sans-serif, script, display? Or "your call":
> - Any specific text beyond title and author? (e.g., tagline, series name, bestseller badge):
>
> **5. Publishing Platform**
>
> - Where will this be published? (Amazon Kindle, KDP Print Paperback, or KDP Print Hardcover?):
>
> Take your time with this. For Premium, I use your brief to develop 3 distinct concept directions — the richer your answers, the more targeted each concept will be.

---

## Phase 3: Receiving the Brief

### Scenario A: Complete, Detailed Brief

**CLIENT:**

> Title: Dead Signal
> Author: Marcus Cole
> Genre: Techno-thriller
> Description: A cybersecurity analyst intercepts an encrypted broadcast from a decommissioned military satellite. What he decodes puts him on a kill list. The signal was never supposed to be found.
> Target audience: Readers of Tom Clancy, Daniel Suarez, Mark Greaney
> Mood: Cold, tense, technological, paranoid
> Visual elements: Satellite dish, digital static/glitch effects, a lone figure in shadow, maybe a cityscape at night
> Colors: Dark blues, blacks, electric cyan accents. Avoid red.
> Scene: The moment he's sitting alone at his terminal and realizes the signal is real
> Reference covers: [3-5 links]
> Covers to avoid: [1-2 links] — too generic, stock photo look
> Font: Sans-serif, clean and modern. Maybe slightly distressed.
> Extra text: "A Novel" under the title
> Platform: Kindle + KDP Print Paperback

**YOU:**

> Excellent brief, Marcus. "Dead Signal" has a killer premise and the visual direction is crystal clear. Here's my plan for your 3 concepts:
>
> **Concept A — "The Terminal"**
> Tight focus on a lone figure at a glowing terminal in a dark room. Satellite data cascading on screens. Cold blue palette with cyan highlights. Intimate, paranoid atmosphere.
>
> **Concept B — "The Signal"**
> A satellite dish against a night sky, surrounded by digital interference/glitch effects. The signal visualized as corrupted data streams. More abstract, high-tech, poster-like.
>
> **Concept C — "The Hunted"**
> Urban nightscape with a solitary figure walking through city streets, surveillance cameras and data overlays suggesting he's being watched. Wider scope, more action-thriller feel.
>
> All three will use the dark blue/black/cyan palette with clean sans-serif typography. No red.
>
> I'll have all 3 concepts ready within 2 business days. Starting now!

---

### Scenario B: Brief With Conflicting Direction

**CLIENT:**

> I want it to feel warm and cozy but also dark and dangerous. Bright colors but also moody. Something minimal but with lots of detail.

**YOU:**

> I appreciate the range of ideas — that actually tells me a lot about the complexity you're going for. Let me translate this into something concrete:
>
> What I'm hearing is you want **contrast** — something that feels inviting but has an undercurrent of tension. That's a great instinct for a cover.
>
> Here's how I'd approach it:
>
> - **Palette:** Warm golds/ambers against deep shadows — cozy warmth with dark edges
> - **Composition:** Clean focal point (minimal feel) but with rich atmospheric detail in the background
> - **Mood:** The "calm before the storm" energy — beautiful surface, something lurking beneath
>
> Does that feel right? If so, I'll build the 3 concepts around different expressions of that contrast. If I'm off, steer me and I'll adjust before starting.

---

## Phase 4: Concept Delivery (3 Concepts)

**YOU:**

> Hi Marcus! Your 3 Premium concepts are ready.
>
> **Concept A — "The Terminal"** > [Image attached]
> Close-up composition — Marcus's character hunched over a glowing terminal, face lit by cyan monitor light. Data streams reflected in his eyes. Tight, claustrophobic framing. Dark blue shadows with electric cyan accents.
>
> **Concept B — "The Signal"** > [Image attached]
> Satellite dish dominating the frame against a black sky, surrounded by digital glitch artifacts and corrupted data streams. Abstract, high-tech aesthetic. The signal visualized as a column of fractured light.
>
> **Concept C — "The Hunted"** > [Image attached]
> Wide urban nightscape — a lone figure on rain-slicked streets, surveillance cameras visible, data overlays ghosting across the buildings. More cinematic, widescreen thriller feel.
>
> All three use the dark blue/black/cyan palette with clean sans-serif typography (placeholder treatment — final typography will be applied to the winning concept).
>
> **What to do next:**
>
> 1. Pick your favorite (A, B, or C) — or tell me which elements from different concepts you'd like combined
> 2. List any changes for Revision Round 1
>
> You have 2 revision rounds with Premium, so there's plenty of room to perfect this.

---

## Phase 5: Revision Round 1

### Scenario A: Clean Selection + Changes

**CLIENT:**

> Concept A is the one. But can you make the terminal screens show more data? And I think the title needs to be a bit more prominent.

**YOU:**

> Concept A it is! I'll make these adjustments:
>
> - Add more visible data on the terminal screens — satellite coordinates, encrypted text, signal waveforms
> - Increase title prominence — larger size, potentially a subtle glow or weight increase to make it pop at thumbnail
>
> This is Revision Round 1 of 2. If there's anything else you want adjusted — colors, character pose, background elements — include it now and I'll address everything in one pass.
>
> I'll have the revised version ready within a few hours.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants Major Conceptual Change

**CLIENT:**

> These are all good but none feel quite right. Can we try something more abstract? Like just the signal itself — no person, no satellite, just data and encryption?

**YOU:**

> Absolutely — we can pivot. Your Premium package includes 2 revision rounds, and this kind of creative direction shift is exactly what they're for.
>
> For Revision Round 1, I'll create a new direction:
>
> - **Pure abstract concept** — the encrypted signal visualized as fractured data, glitch patterns, and cryptographic symbols against a dark void. No human figure, no hardware. Just the signal.
> - Same dark blue/black/cyan palette
> - Clean sans-serif typography integrated into the data aesthetic
>
> You'll still have Revision Round 2 after this to fine-tune the result.
>
> I'll have the new concept ready within 1 business day.

---

### Scenario C: Client Loves It, Minimal Changes

**CLIENT:**

> Concept C is amazing, almost perfect. Just make the surveillance cameras a tiny bit more visible and we're done.

**YOU:**

> Easy fix! I'll make the surveillance cameras more prominent — slightly brighter, more defined, so the "being watched" theme reads clearly.
>
> This uses Revision Round 1. You still have Revision Round 2 available after you see this update, in case anything else catches your eye.
>
> Updated version coming within a few hours.

---

## Phase 6: Revision Round 2

### Scenario A: Further Fine-Tuning

**CLIENT:**

> The cameras look great now. One more thing — can the author name be in a slightly lighter shade? It's getting lost against the background.

**YOU:**

> Good eye — I'll brighten the author name so it stands out clearly. Lighter shade against the dark background will improve readability, especially at thumbnail size.
>
> This is Revision Round 2 of 2 (your final included round). I'll apply this and do my final polish pass — color correction, composition tightening, and typography refinement.
>
> If everything looks good after this, I'll prepare your final delivery files.

---

### Scenario B: Client Happy After Round 1, Skips Round 2

**CLIENT:**

> Revision 1 looks perfect. I don't need Round 2. Let's finalize!

**YOU:**

> Love it! I'll apply the final typography treatment, do a full polish pass — color correction, composition tightening, and sharpening — and prepare your delivery files.
>
> Final cover will be ready within a few hours. Note: your unused Round 2 doesn't expire. If you spot anything after receiving the final files, you can still use it.

---

### Scenario C: Client Wants More Changes After Round 2

**CLIENT:**

> Actually, after seeing the Round 2 version, I want to change the tagline text. Is that possible?

**YOU:**

> Of course! Your 2 included revision rounds are now used, but this is a small text change — it falls under a Cover Minor Revision at $75.
>
> That covers any text fix, color adjustment, or subtitle change. I can have it done within 1 business day.
>
> Want me to go ahead?

---

## Phase 7: Final Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi Marcus! Your final Premium cover is complete.
>
> **"Dead Signal" — Final Cover** > [Image attached]
>
> **Delivered files:**
>
> - `Dead-Signal-Cover-FINAL.png` (1600x2400, 300 DPI)
> - `Dead-Signal-Cover-FINAL.jpg` (1600x2400, 300 DPI)
>
> **Files delivered via:** Google Drive link / ZIP attachment
>
> **How to use:**
>
> - **Kindle:** Upload the PNG or JPG directly as your ebook cover in KDP
> - **KDP Print Paperback:** Upload as the front cover image, then use Amazon's Cover Creator for spine and back cover
>
> Please download and verify everything — check the title spelling, author name, and that the image looks correct at both full size and when you shrink it to thumbnail size (that's how most readers will first see it on Amazon).
>
> If you spot anything at all, you still have your unused Revision Round 2 available (or Revision Round 2 was used — in which case, minor fixes are always $75).
>
> It's been a pleasure working on "Dead Signal." If you're happy with the result, a Reedsy review would mean the world — it helps other authors find me. And when you're ready for the next book in the series, returning clients get 10% off!

---

## Phase 8: Post-Delivery Scenarios

### Scenario A: Client Wants Matching Covers for Series

**CLIENT:**

> This is exactly what I wanted. I have 4 more books in this series. Can you make matching covers?

**YOU:**

> Absolutely — and matching is much easier now that we've established the visual identity with "Dead Signal."
>
> For 5 books total (including the one we just did), I'd suggest:
>
> **Option 1: Series Branding — Standard (5 Books) — $2,200**
> Includes 5 visually consistent front covers, series logo, box set front cover, and 1 revision round. Since we already have Book 1’s style locked in, I’ll match the remaining 4 covers to it and include the series logo + box set cover.
>
> **Option 2: Individual covers — $350 each (Add New Book Cover)**
> 4 new covers at $350 each = $1,400. But you won’t get the series logo or box set cover.
>
> The branding package is the better value — you get the logo and box set cover included, plus I build all 5 covers as a unified visual system.
>
> Want me to send the series branding brief?

---

### Scenario B: Client Asks for Files in Different Format

**CLIENT:**

> Can I also get the file as a PDF? My distributor needs that format.

**YOU:**

> I can convert the final cover to PDF — no problem. I'll include it with your delivery files at no extra charge. PNG, JPG, and PDF all at 1600x2400, 300 DPI.

---

### Scenario C: Client Asks About AI Usage

**CLIENT:**

> Quick question — do you use AI tools in creating the covers?

**YOU:**

> Yes, I use AI-assisted image generation as part of my creative pipeline. Here's how it works:
>
> - I use AI tools to generate the base imagery, guided by detailed prompts built from your creative brief
> - I then do extensive post-processing: composition adjustments, color grading, lighting refinement, and professional typography
> - The creative direction, genre positioning, and quality control are all mine — the AI is a tool, not the designer
>
> This is the same pipeline I used to create covers for all 22 of my published Amazon titles across 3 series. The results speak for themselves — you can see every cover live on Amazon.
>
> If you have any concerns about AI usage, I'm happy to discuss before we proceed.

## Follow-Up Template (If Client Goes Silent)

After 3 days of no response:

**YOU:**

> Hi Marcus! Just checking in — wanted to make sure you received the concepts and see if you have any questions or feedback. No rush at all, just making sure nothing got lost. Let me know whenever you're ready!

After 7 days:

**YOU:**

> Hi Marcus — one more check-in. Your project is still active and I have everything saved. Whenever you're ready to continue, just send your feedback and I'll pick right up where we left off. If your plans have changed, just let me know — no worries either way!
