---

## Phase 1: Initial Inquiry

### Scenario A: Parent/Author With a Story Written

**CLIENT:**

> Hi, I've written a children's picture book and I need illustrations for all 32 pages plus a cover. Can you help?

**YOU:**

> Hi! Absolutely — children's picture book illustration is one of my core services. I create all 32 page illustrations plus the cover, with consistent character design across every page.
>
> My Standard package is $1,800 and includes:
>
> - 32 fully illustrated pages in a consistent art style (Pixar/Disney-inspired or your preferred direction)
> - Consistent character design — same appearance, proportions, and clothing on every page
> - Front cover illustration
> - Assembled PDF with illustrations and text laid out together — ready for digital distribution
> - All 32 page illustrations as separate high-resolution image files
> - 1 round of revisions
> - 2 business day delivery
>
> **Important:** I handle the illustration only. You provide the story text, and I create all the artwork. I don't write stories.
>
> Do you have your story ready to share? I'll send you a creative brief to fill out so I can nail the art direction.

---

### Scenario B: Client Has an Idea But No Written Story

**CLIENT:**

> I have an idea for a children's book about a little girl who befriends a dragon. But I haven't written the story yet. Can you still help?

**YOU:**

> I focus on illustration only — I don't write the story text. You'd need to have the written story (the text for each page) before I can start illustrating.
>
> Here's what I recommend:
>
> 1. **Write your story first** — aim for 1-3 sentences per page across 32 pages. Keep it simple and visual — each page should describe a scene I can illustrate.
> 2. **Once your text is ready**, send it to me with the creative brief and I'll illustrate every page.
>
> If you need help with the writing, Reedsy has excellent children's book editors and ghostwriters who can develop your concept into a full manuscript. Once you have the text, I'm ready to bring it to life visually.
>
> Would you like me to send you the creative brief now so you can start thinking about the art direction while you write?

---

### Scenario C: Client Asks About Print vs Digital

**CLIENT:**

> I want to publish on Amazon KDP as a paperback. Does your Standard package support that?

**YOU:**

> The Standard package delivers a digital-ready PDF — perfect for Kindle ebook distribution. For **print-ready paperback** (with proper bleed, margins, and gutter for KDP Print), you'd want the **Plus package ($2,400)**, which includes:
>
> - Everything in Standard
> - Front AND back cover images (not just front)
> - Print-ready PDF formatted to KDP Print specifications (bleed, margins, gutter)
> - 2 revision rounds instead of 1
>
> If your goal is a physical paperback on Amazon, the Plus package is the right choice. The Standard works great for Kindle Kids and digital-only distribution.
>
> Which format are you targeting?

---

### Scenario D: Client Asks About Art Style

**CLIENT:**

> What art style do you work in? I want something bright and fun, not dark or realistic.

**YOU:**

> My default children's book style is Pixar/Disney-inspired — bright, warm, expressive characters with clean compositions. Think fun, engaging, and age-appropriate.
>
> But I'm flexible on direction. I can work in:
>
> - **Pixar/Disney-inspired** — 3D-look, bright, cinematic lighting, expressive faces
> - **Soft watercolor** — gentle, dreamy, storybook feel
> - **Flat illustration** — modern, clean, bold shapes and colors
> - **Custom direction** — if you have reference art or books whose style you admire, I'll match that aesthetic
>
> The best way to communicate style is to send me 2-3 children's books whose illustrations you love. I'll use those as the reference point for your project.
>
> Want me to send the creative brief?

---

### Scenario E: Client Asks About Character Consistency

**CLIENT:**

> How do you make sure the characters look the same on every page? That's been my biggest concern with other illustrators.

**YOU:**

> Great question — character consistency is the single most important technical challenge in picture books, and it's one of my strengths.
>
> I use a technique called **style anchoring** — before illustrating any pages, I establish the character's exact appearance (face, proportions, hair, skin tone, clothing, expressions) and use that as a locked reference across all 32 pages.
>
> The result: your main character looks like the same person on page 1 and page 32. Same goes for supporting characters.
>
> If you want to see this in action, my portfolio shows consistent character design across entire book series. The Premium package ($3,200) includes dedicated **character reference sheets** created before production begins, which takes consistency even further. But the Standard package uses the same anchoring technique — just without a separate reference sheet deliverable.

---

## AI Transparency & Client Consent (Reedsy Compliance — Required)

> **This disclosure must be sent BEFORE proceeding to the creative brief. Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, you must obtain the client's written consent before any AI-assisted tools are used in the project.**

After the client expresses interest and before sending the creative brief, send the following:

**YOU:**

> Before we move forward, I want to be fully transparent about my creative process — I share this with every client upfront, and Reedsy requires it.
>
> My illustration workflow uses **AI-assisted image generation** as a core part of the creative pipeline. I use advanced prompt engineering techniques to generate high-quality visual concepts for your illustrations and cover art, which I then refine, composite, color-grade, and finalize into production-ready artwork.
>
> **What this means in practice:**
>
> - I translate your creative brief — characters, scenes, mood, and art style — into detailed image generation prompts, each one carefully engineered to capture your story's world and characters
> - Each illustration goes through multiple rounds of generation, selection, and refinement — I generate dozens of variations and curate the strongest results
> - I ensure character consistency across all illustrations so your characters look the same on every page
> - I composite, color-grade, and enhance the selected outputs to achieve a cohesive, polished visual style throughout the book
> - Typography, layout, and final production are handled with professional design precision
> - Every deliverable is a polished, commercially ready, print-quality product — not a raw AI output
>
> **What this does NOT mean:**
>
> - This is not "type a sentence and use the first thing that appears." Every illustration goes through an extensive creative process driven by my expertise in visual storytelling, children's book conventions, and publishing requirements.
> - I've published 22 books across 3 series on Amazon — all designed using this exact pipeline. The quality and consistency speak for themselves.
>
> **Please take a look at my portfolio to see the quality this process delivers:**
>
> - https://metronagon.com/ai-transparency — full details on my AI-assisted process, copyright protections, and a real example prompt
> - https://metronagon.com/examples — cover gallery across multiple genres
> - https://metronagon.com/case-studies — complete series case studies showing visual consistency across multiple books
>
> Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, I need your written confirmation that you're comfortable with AI-assisted tools being part of the creative process before we proceed.
>
> Happy to answer any questions about how it works.

### Client Response: Accepts

**CLIENT:**

> That's totally fine with me. Your portfolio looks great — let's go!

**YOU:**

> Thank you — I appreciate both the trust and the chance to bring your story to life. I'll note your consent in our project record and send you the creative brief next.

---

### Client Response: Has Questions About Quality / Style Consistency

**CLIENT:**

> I'm open to it, but children's books are very visual — I need the illustrations to feel warm and hand-crafted, not "AI-looking." Can you guarantee that?

**YOU:**

> Completely fair concern, and especially important for children's books where the art IS the experience. Here's how I deliver that warmth and quality:
>
> 1. **Your brief drives every prompt.** I don't use templates or generic inputs. Every illustration prompt is custom-built from YOUR specific characters, scenes, color palette, and art style direction.
> 2. **Character consistency.** This is critical for children's books — your main character needs to look the same on every page. I engineer prompts that maintain consistent character design, proportions, and style throughout.
> 3. **Iterative refinement.** I generate dozens of variations per illustration, then select, composite, and refine the strongest elements — it's a curation and design process, not a one-shot output.
> 4. **Art style matching.** Whether you want watercolor, digital painting, cartoon, whimsical, or storybook — I dial in the style through my prompts and maintain it across every illustration.
> 5. **Professional finishing.** Color grading, composition, and production polish are all applied with the care that children's books demand.
>
> Check my portfolio for proof: https://metronagon.com/case-studies — you'll see the level of visual consistency I maintain across entire series.
>
> If you're comfortable, just confirm and I'll send the creative brief!

---

### Client Response: Has Copyright Concerns

**CLIENT:**

> I've read that AI-generated images can't be copyrighted. Will that be a problem for my children's book?

**YOU:**

> Important question — and one I take very seriously as a professional.
>
> You're right that the US Copyright Office has indicated that purely AI-generated images with minimal human input may lack full copyright protection on their own. However, my workflow involves substantial human creative direction at every stage: concept development, detailed prompt engineering, visual selection, compositing, refinement, layout, and production design.
>
> The final illustrations you receive are not raw AI outputs — they're professionally designed artwork that reflects significant human creative decision-making throughout the entire process.
>
> As a Reedsy professional, I bear full legal responsibility for ensuring that your deliverables are commercially exploitable and free of copyright issues. That's my obligation to you, and I stand behind it completely.
>
> You'll receive production-ready files that you can use commercially on Amazon, IngramSpark, or any other publishing platform without restriction.

---

### Client Response: Declines AI-Assisted Work

**CLIENT:**

> I appreciate the honesty, but I'd prefer a hand-drawn illustrator for my children's book. Nothing personal.

**YOU:**

> No offense taken at all — I genuinely respect that preference, especially for children's books where many authors have a specific vision for the art style. I'd always rather be upfront than surprise you later.
>
> I'd suggest browsing Reedsy's other illustrators who specialize in traditional illustration or hand-drawn digital art. If you ever want to see what my pipeline can deliver, my portfolio is always open: https://metronagon.com/examples
>
> Best of luck with your book — I hope it becomes a bedtime favorite!

---

## Phase 2: Creative Brief Request

**YOU:**

> Here's the creative brief for your children's picture book. The more detail you provide — especially about characters — the better the illustrations will be.
>
> **CREATIVE BRIEF — Children's Picture Book (Standard)**
>
> **1. Story Details**
>
> - Do you have a story written already? If yes, please attach it:
> - Book concept — What is the story about? (3-5 sentences):
> - Target age group (e.g., 2-4, 4-6, 6-8):
> - Main character(s) — Name, age, appearance (hair color/style, skin tone, clothing, distinguishing features):
> - Supporting characters — Brief descriptions:
> - Setting — Where does the story take place?
> - Tone — Fun and silly, gentle, adventurous, educational?
> - Lesson or message — Is there a moral or theme?
>
> **2. Visual Direction**
>
> - Art style — Pixar/Disney-inspired, watercolor, flat illustration, or other? (Or "your call"):
> - Color palette — Bright, soft pastels, warm earth tones, or specific colors?
> - Reference books or art — Children's books whose illustration style you admire:
>
> **3. Text and Layout**
>
> - How much text per page? (1-3 sentences is standard):
> - Any pages with no text? (Full-bleed illustration pages?):
>
> **4. Special Pages**
>
> - Dedication page text (e.g., "For my little adventurer, Emma"):
> - Any special requests? (Hidden details, inside jokes, a specific scene):
>
> **5. Publishing Platform**
>
> - Where will this be published? (Amazon Kindle Kids, KDP Print Paperback, or KDP Print Hardcover?):
> - Trim size preference — Standard is 8.5" x 8.5" square:
>
> **6. Story Text**
>
> - Please attach your complete story text, ideally broken down page-by-page (e.g., "Page 1: [text]", "Page 2: [text]", etc.)
>
> The story text is the most critical piece. I need to know exactly what happens on each page to plan the illustrations.

---

## Phase 3: Receiving the Brief

### Scenario A: Complete Brief With Story Text

**CLIENT:**

> Here's everything:
> Title: "Milo and the Moon Garden"
> Author: Jennifer Park
> Age group: 4-6
> Concept: Milo, a curious 5-year-old boy, discovers a secret garden that only appears under moonlight. Each night he visits, the garden grows bigger and more magical — but only if he's kind during the day.
>
> Main character: Milo — 5 years old, messy brown hair, big green eyes, wears overalls and rain boots, always has dirt on his face
> Supporting characters: Luna (a talking rabbit who guards the garden), Mom (warm, curly red hair)
> Setting: A small house with a backyard that transforms into the moon garden at night
> Tone: Gentle, magical, warm
> Lesson: Kindness creates beauty
> Style: Pixar/Disney-inspired, bright moonlit colors
> Colors: Silver-blue moonlight, glowing whites, warm amber for daytime scenes, magical purples
>
> [Attaches full 32-page story text, page by page]
>
> Dedication: "For my little gardener, Sophie"
> Platform: Kindle Kids
> Trim: 8.5" x 8.5"

**YOU:**

> Jennifer, this is a beautiful story — "Milo and the Moon Garden" has wonderful visual potential. Here's my plan:
>
> **Character Design:**
>
> - Milo: 5 years old, messy brown hair, big green eyes, overalls + rain boots, dirt-smudged cheeks. Expressive, curious body language.
> - Luna: A soft, ethereal white rabbit with gentle, wise eyes. Slightly luminous — she glows faintly in moonlight.
> - Mom: Warm smile, curly red hair, cozy clothing. Appears in daytime scenes.
>
> **Art Direction:**
>
> - Pixar/Disney-inspired with cinematic lighting
> - Two visual modes: **Daytime** (warm amber, golden sunlight, cozy house) and **Nighttime/Garden** (silver-blue moonlight, glowing whites, magical purples)
> - The garden grows progressively more magical and lush from the first night visit to the last
> - Every illustration has a warm, gentle quality — safe and magical, not scary
>
> **Page Layout:**
>
> - 8.5" x 8.5" square format
> - Text positioned below or alongside illustrations (never obscuring key visual elements)
> - Dedication page: "For my little gardener, Sophie" with a small illustration of a moonlit flower
>
> I'll illustrate all 32 pages + front cover and assemble the complete PDF. Delivery in 2 business days. Starting now!

---

### Scenario B: Story Text Not Page-Broken

**CLIENT:**

> Here's my story [sends one continuous block of text, not broken into pages]

**YOU:**

> Thanks for the story! Before I start illustrating, I need to break this into 32 pages. Two options:
>
> 1. **You do it** — Divide your text into 32 roughly equal chunks. Each chunk becomes one page. Think about where the natural "scene breaks" are — each page should describe one visual moment.
>
> 2. **I do it** — I'll read through the story and create a page-by-page breakdown based on pacing, scene changes, and visual storytelling beats. I'll send it to you for approval before I start illustrating.
>
> Option 2 is usually faster and produces better pacing. Want me to go ahead and create the page breakdown?

---

### Scenario C: Story Is Too Long or Too Short for 32 Pages

**CLIENT:**

> My story is only 15 pages of text. Is that enough for 32 illustrated pages?

**YOU:**

> 15 pages of text can absolutely fill 32 illustrated pages. Here's how:
>
> - Some pages will have text + illustration (your 15 text sections)
> - Other pages will be **full-bleed illustrations** — no text, just a powerful visual that lets the story breathe
> - Title page, dedication page, and a final image page also use some of those 32 pages
>
> Full-bleed pages are standard in children's books — they create pacing and let key moments land visually. I'll plan which pages are text+illustration and which are illustration-only based on the story's rhythm.
>
> Send me your text and I'll create the full 32-page layout plan for your approval.

**CLIENT (alternative):**

> My story is quite long — maybe 50+ pages of text. Can you fit it in 32 pages?

**YOU:**

> 32 pages is the standard for a picture book, and it works best with 1-3 sentences per page. If your text runs longer, we have two options:
>
> 1. **Edit down** — Tighten the text to fit 32 pages. Most picture book stories benefit from being concise — let the illustrations carry the visual storytelling.
> 2. **Add pages** — If the story truly needs more space, additional pages are available at $100/page (Children's Book — Add Page).
>
> I'd recommend option 1 first. Send me the text and I'll tell you how it fits within 32 pages and where you might trim.

---

## Phase 4: Illustration Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi Jennifer! All 32 illustrations + front cover are ready for "Milo and the Moon Garden."
>
> **Front Cover** > [Image attached]
> Milo standing at the entrance to the glowing moon garden, Luna the rabbit at his feet, moonlight streaming through the gate. Title and author name positioned at the top.
>
> **Sample Pages (showing the range):**
>
> **Page 1** — Milo in his bedroom, looking out the window at the moonlit backyard. Warm amber interior light, cool blue moonlight through the glass. Text at the bottom.
> [Image attached]
>
> **Page 8** — First night in the garden. Milo's face lit with wonder as he sees glowing flowers for the first time. Luna watches from behind a crystal bush. Silver-blue palette with magical purple highlights.
> [Image attached]
>
> **Page 16** — Midpoint. The garden at its most magical — towering luminous trees, floating petals, Milo laughing as he runs through a field of starflowers.
> [Image attached]
>
> **Page 32** — Final page. Milo in bed, smiling in his sleep. Through the window, a single moonlit flower glows in the real backyard. Full circle.
> [Image attached]
>
> **Complete set:** All 32 page illustrations + front cover attached individually + assembled PDF with text laid out.
>
> **What to do next:**
>
> 1. Review all pages carefully — check character consistency, text placement, and the overall visual flow
> 2. List any changes you'd like — this is your 1 included revision round
> 3. Compile everything into one message so I can address it all in a single pass
>
> **Things to check:**
>
> - Does Milo look like Milo on every page? (Character consistency)
> - Is the text readable against the illustrations?
> - Does the story flow visually from page to page?
> - Are the colors and mood what you expected?
>
> Take your time!

---

## Phase 5: Revision Round

### Scenario A: Targeted Page Changes

**CLIENT:**

> This is incredible! Just a few things:
>
> - Page 5: Milo's hair looks too neat — he should be messier
> - Page 12: Luna should be closer to Milo in this scene, they're becoming friends
> - Page 22: The garden should look slightly wilted here — this is the "sad" part of the story
> - Cover: Can the title be a bit more whimsical? Maybe a curvy font?
> - Everything else is perfect

**YOU:**

> Great feedback! I'll address all four:
>
> 1. Page 5 — Messier hair on Milo, more tousled and wild
> 2. Page 12 — Move Luna closer to Milo, more intimate positioning
> 3. Page 22 — Wilt the garden: drooping flowers, muted colors, less glow
> 4. Cover — Switch to a more whimsical, curvy font for the title
>
> This is your included revision round, so if there's anything else — any page, any detail — now's the time to mention it. I'll deliver all updates together.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants Multiple Pages Redone

**CLIENT:**

> Pages 1-20 are amazing but pages 21-30 feel rushed. Can you redo those?

**YOU:**

> I appreciate the honesty. 10 pages is a significant revision — I'll address as much as possible in your included round.
>
> To make this most effective, please tell me for each page (21-30):
>
> - What specifically feels rushed? (Less detail? Wrong scene? Composition too simple?)
> - What would "not rushed" look like? (More background detail? More character expression? Different angle?)
>
> The more specific you are, the better I can fix everything in one pass. If some pages need complete reimagining beyond what one revision round covers, additional page edits are $75/page (Children's Book — Page Edit).

---

### Scenario C: Character Consistency Issue

**CLIENT:**

> Milo looks different on pages 14, 19, and 27 — his eyes are the wrong color and his overalls look different.

**YOU:**

> Thank you for catching that — character consistency is critical and I'll fix those immediately. I'll re-anchor Milo's character reference for those 3 pages:
>
> - Correct eye color to green
> - Match overalls to the established design from the rest of the book
>
> I'll also do a full consistency check across all 32 pages to make sure nothing else drifted. This is part of your revision round.

---

## Phase 6: Final Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi Jennifer! "Milo and the Moon Garden" is finalized and ready for publishing.
>
> **Final Delivery:**
>
> **Assembled PDF:**
>
> - `Milo-and-the-Moon-Garden-COMPLETE.pdf` — All 32 pages with text laid out, in page order, ready for Kindle Kids upload
>
> **Front Cover:**
>
> - `Milo-and-the-Moon-Garden-Cover.png` (high-resolution)
> - `Milo-and-the-Moon-Garden-Cover.jpg` (high-resolution)
>
> **Individual Page Files:**
>
> - `Page-01.png` through `Page-32.png` — All 32 illustrations as separate high-resolution files
>
> **Files delivered via:** Google Drive link (organized in folders: /PDF, /Cover, /Pages)
>
> **How to use:**
>
> - **Kindle Kids:** Upload the assembled PDF directly
> - **Cover:** Upload the cover PNG/JPG as your ebook cover in KDP
>
> **Note:** This PDF is formatted for digital distribution. If you later decide to do a print paperback, the Plus package upgrade adds print-ready formatting (bleed, margins, gutter) and a back cover — or we can discuss a custom quote for print conversion.
>
> Please download and review the final PDF page by page. Check text readability, page order, and overall flow.
>
> "Milo and the Moon Garden" is a beautiful book, Jennifer. A Reedsy review would mean the world — and returning clients get 10% off future projects!

---

## Phase 7: Post-Delivery Scenarios

### Scenario A: Client Wants Print Version

**CLIENT:**

> The Kindle version looks great! Now I want to do a paperback too. Can you make it print-ready?

**YOU:**

> Absolutely! To convert to print-ready format, I'd need to:
>
> - Add proper bleed, margins, and gutter for KDP Print
> - Create a back cover illustration
> - Reformat the PDF to your chosen trim size with print specifications
>
> This is essentially upgrading to the Plus package scope. Two options:
>
> 1. **Plus upgrade — $600** (the difference between Standard at $1,800 and Plus at $2,400). You get: print-ready PDF, back cover illustration, and 2 revision rounds on the new deliverables.
>
> 2. **Individual add-ons:** Back cover alone is custom (contact for quote), plus print formatting.
>
> The upgrade at $600 is the cleaner path. Want to proceed?

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants to Change Story Text After Delivery

**CLIENT:**

> My editor made some text changes. Can you update the PDF with the new text?

**YOU:**

> Of course! If the text changes don't require new illustrations (just text swaps in the existing layout), I can update the PDF.
>
> - Minor text changes across the book: **$75** (Book Description Update pricing — since it's text-only work)
> - If any text changes require illustration modifications (e.g., a new scene described), those are **$75/page** (Children's Book — Page Edit)
>
> Send me the updated text and I'll let you know which category it falls under.

---

### Scenario C: Client Wants a Second Book

**CLIENT:**

> Kids loved the first book! I'm writing "Milo and the Star River" as a sequel. Can you do illustrations again?

**YOU:**

> I'd love to! Since we already have Milo's character design established, the sequel will be even smoother — I'll use the exact same character anchoring from Book 1 for perfect consistency.
>
> Same Standard package at $1,800, with the added benefit of locked-in character design from the first book.
>
> Send me the story text and creative brief whenever you're ready. Returning clients get 10% off — so this would be **$1,620**.

---

## Follow-Up Template (If Client Goes Silent)

After 3 days:

**YOU:**

> Hi Jennifer! Just checking in — wanted to see if you've had a chance to review the illustrations. Your revision round is still available whenever you're ready. No rush!

After 7 days:

**YOU:**

> Hi Jennifer — one more check-in. All your files are saved and your revision round is still active. Whenever you're ready to review, just send your feedback. If plans have changed, no worries at all!
