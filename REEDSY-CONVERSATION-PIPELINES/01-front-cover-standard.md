---

## Phase 1: Initial Inquiry (Client Messages You First)

### Scenario A: Vague Inquiry

**CLIENT:**

> Hi, I'm looking for a book cover for my novel. Can you tell me about your services?

**YOU:**

> Hi! Thanks for reaching out. I'd love to help.
>
> I design front cover images for Amazon KDP books — Kindle ebook and paperback. I've published 22 books across 3 series on Amazon, so I know exactly what works at thumbnail size and what converts browsers into buyers.
>
> My Standard package is $450 and includes:
>
> - 2 fully realized concept variations based on your brief
> - 1 polished final with professional typography
> - 1 round of revisions
> - Delivered as high-res PNG/JPG (1600x2400, 300 DPI) — Amazon KDP-ready
> - 3–5 business day turnaround
>
> If you'd like more concepts and revision rounds, the Premium package ($650) gives you 3 concepts and 2 revision rounds.
>
> Could you tell me a bit about your book? Genre, title, and what kind of feel you're going for? I can let you know which package fits best.

---

### Scenario B: Specific Inquiry (Client Knows What They Want)

**CLIENT:**

> Hi, I need a cover for my fantasy novel. It's called "The Ember Throne" and I'm looking for something dark and epic. What are your rates?

**YOU:**

> Hi! "The Ember Throne" — great title. Fantasy covers are my specialty — my Aztec Samurai Adventures series is a 12-book fantasy epic on Amazon, so I've done this exact kind of work extensively.
>
> For a single front cover, my Standard package is $450:
>
> - 2 concept variations — two fully realized visual directions you can compare side by side
> - 1 polished final with professional typography
> - 1 revision round
> - 1600x2400, 300 DPI — Amazon KDP-ready
> - 1 business day delivery
>
> For dark/epic fantasy, I typically work in a cinematic photorealistic style — think dramatic lighting, rich atmosphere, and genre-accurate composition that pops at thumbnail size.
>
> Want to move forward? I'll send you a creative brief to fill out so I can nail the visual direction.

---

### Scenario C: Price Comparison / Hesitation

**CLIENT:**

> Hi, your work looks great but I've seen covers for $50-80 on Fiverr. Why should I pay $450?

**YOU:**

> Fair question. The difference comes down to three things:
>
> 1. **Genre accuracy.** I've published 22 books on Amazon across 3 series. I know what sells at thumbnail size because I've done it for my own books — not just as a designer, but as someone who watches real Amazon sales data.
>
> 2. **Concepts, not mockups.** You get 2 fully realized visual directions, not generic template swaps. Each concept is built from your specific brief with custom composition, lighting, and typography.
>
> 3. **Production-ready files.** 1600x2400, 300 DPI, optimized for KDP. No upscaling artifacts, no wrong dimensions, no back-and-forth with Amazon's cover validator.
>
> Fiverr covers at $50 are usually template-based with stock imagery. If you're serious about your book looking professional on Amazon, $450 reflects the depth of custom creative work involved — each cover starts with a 2,500–3,000 word creative brief tailored to your book.

### Scenario D: Client Asks About Print Wraps / Spine / Back Cover

**CLIENT:**

> Do you do full print covers with spine and back?

**YOU:**

> I design front cover images only — the image buyers see when browsing Amazon. I don't design spines or back covers.
>
> For KDP Print paperbacks, Amazon's Cover Creator tool handles the spine and back cover layout using your front cover image. Most indie authors use that workflow and it works well.
>
> My Standard package ($450) gives you a front cover at 1600x2400, 300 DPI — perfect for both Kindle and the front panel of a KDP Print paperback.
>
> Would you like to move forward with a front cover?

---

## AI Transparency & Client Consent (Reedsy Compliance — Required)

> **This disclosure must be sent BEFORE proceeding to the creative brief. Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, you must obtain the client's written consent before any AI-assisted tools are used in the project.**

After the client expresses interest and before sending the creative brief, send the following:

**YOU:**

> Before we move forward, I want to be fully transparent about my creative process — I share this with every client upfront, and Reedsy requires it.
>
> My design workflow uses **AI-assisted image generation** as a core part of the creative pipeline. I use advanced prompt engineering techniques to generate high-quality visual concepts, which I then refine, composite, color-grade, and finalize into production-ready cover art.
>
> **What this means in practice:**
>
> - I translate your creative brief into detailed, genre-specific image generation prompts — each one carefully engineered to capture your book's characters, setting, mood, and genre conventions
> - Each concept goes through multiple rounds of generation, selection, and refinement — I generate dozens of variations and curate the strongest results
> - I composite, color-grade, and enhance the selected outputs to achieve a cohesive, polished visual
> - Typography, layout, and final production are handled with professional design precision
> - The final deliverable is a polished, commercially ready, print-quality product — not a raw AI output
>
> **What this does NOT mean:**
>
> - This is not "type a sentence and use the first thing that appears." Every cover goes through an extensive creative process driven by my expertise in book cover design, genre conventions, and Amazon marketplace requirements.
> - I've published 22 books across 3 series on Amazon — all designed using this exact pipeline. The results speak for themselves.
>
> **Please take a look at my portfolio to see the quality this process delivers:**
>
> - https://metronagon.com/ai-transparency — full details on my AI-assisted process, copyright protections, and a real example prompt
> - https://metronagon.com/examples — cover gallery across multiple genres
> - https://metronagon.com/case-studies — complete series case studies showing visual consistency across multiple books
>
> Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, I need your written confirmation that you're comfortable with AI-assisted tools being part of the creative process before we proceed.
>
> Happy to answer any questions about how it works.

### Client Response: Accepts

**CLIENT:**

> That's totally fine with me. Your portfolio looks great — let's go!

**YOU:**

> Thank you — I appreciate both the trust and the chance to work on this. I'll note your consent in our project record and send you the creative brief next.

---

### Client Response: Has Questions About Quality / Uniqueness

**CLIENT:**

> I'm open to it, but I want to make sure my cover won't look "AI-generated" or generic. How do you ensure quality?

**YOU:**

> Completely fair concern, and one I take seriously. Here's how I deliver professional-grade results:
>
> 1. **Your brief drives every prompt.** I don't use templates or generic inputs. Every image generation prompt is custom-built from YOUR specific characters, settings, mood, color palette, and genre.
> 2. **Iterative refinement.** I generate dozens of variations per concept, then select, composite, and refine the strongest elements — it's a curation and design process, not a one-shot output.
> 3. **Professional finishing.** Typography, composition, color grading, and production polish are all applied with the same rigor as any professional design workflow.
> 4. **Genre expertise.** I know what works on Amazon because I sell there myself. Your cover will look like it belongs on a bestseller shelf, not on an AI demo page.
>
> Check my case studies for proof: https://metronagon.com/case-studies — you'll see complete series with consistent visual identity across multiple books. That level of design intention doesn't happen by accident.
>
> If you're comfortable, just confirm and I'll send the creative brief!

---

### Client Response: Has Copyright Concerns

**CLIENT:**

> I've read that AI-generated images can't be copyrighted. Will that be a problem for my cover?

**YOU:**

> Important question — and one I take very seriously as a professional.
>
> You're right that the US Copyright Office has indicated that purely AI-generated images with minimal human input may lack full copyright protection on their own. However, my workflow involves substantial human creative direction at every stage: concept development, detailed prompt engineering, visual selection, compositing, refinement, typography, layout, and production design.
>
> The final product you receive is not a raw AI output — it's a professionally designed cover that reflects significant human creative decision-making throughout the entire process.
>
> As a Reedsy professional, I bear full legal responsibility for ensuring that your deliverables are commercially exploitable and free of copyright issues. That's my obligation to you, and I stand behind it completely.
>
> You'll receive production-ready files that you can use commercially on Amazon, IngramSpark, or any other publishing platform without restriction.

---

### Client Response: Declines AI-Assisted Work

**CLIENT:**

> I appreciate the honesty, but I'd prefer a designer who works without AI tools. Nothing personal.

**YOU:**

> No offense taken at all — I genuinely respect that preference, and I'd always rather be upfront than surprise you later.
>
> I'd suggest browsing Reedsy's other designers who specialize in hand-illustrated or traditional digital painting approaches. If you ever want to see what my pipeline can deliver, my portfolio is always open: https://metronagon.com/examples
>
> Best of luck with your book!

---

## Phase 2: Creative Brief Request

Once the client confirms interest:

**YOU:**

> Great, let's get started! To create your cover concepts, I need the following information. Take your time filling this out — the more detail you give me, the better your covers will be.
>
> **CREATIVE BRIEF — Front Cover Design (Standard)**
>
> **1. Book Details**
>
> - Book title (and subtitle, if any):
> - Author name (exactly as it should appear on the cover):
> - Genre (e.g., thriller, romance, sci-fi, fantasy, literary fiction):
> - Brief book description (2-3 sentences about the story or subject matter):
>
> **2. Visual Direction**
>
> - Mood/tone — What feeling should the cover evoke? (e.g., dark and intense, warm and hopeful, mysterious, epic, whimsical):
> - Key visual elements — Specific objects, scenes, or symbols that should appear:
> - Color preferences — Colors you love or want to avoid:
> - Style preference — Photorealistic or stylized?
>
> **3. Reference Covers**
>
> - 2-3 existing book covers you admire — covers whose style, composition, or mood you'd want yours to echo (Amazon links or screenshots are fine):
>
> **4. Typography**
>
> - Font style preference — Serif (classic), sans-serif (modern), script (elegant), or display (bold/decorative)? Or say "your call":
>
> **5. Publishing Platform**
>
> - Where will this be published? (Amazon Kindle, KDP Print Paperback, or KDP Print Hardcover?):
>
> Send this back whenever you're ready and I'll start working on your concepts.

---

## Phase 3: Receiving the Brief

### Scenario A: Complete Brief

**CLIENT:**

> Here's my brief:
> Title: The Ember Throne
> Author: Sarah Mitchell
> Genre: Epic Fantasy
> Description: A young blacksmith discovers she can forge weapons from living fire. When the kingdom's ancient throne begins to crumble, she must choose between saving her village or claiming the power that could destroy it.
> Mood: Dark, epic, dramatic — like a movie poster
> Visual elements: A glowing throne made of embers, a young woman with fire in her hands, dark castle in the background
> Colors: Deep reds, oranges, blacks, gold accents
> Style: Photorealistic
> References: [links to 3 fantasy covers]
> Font: Your call
> Platform: Kindle + KDP Print Paperback

**YOU:**

> Perfect brief, Sarah — this gives me everything I need. Here's what I'm going to do:
>
> I'll create 2 distinct concept variations based on your brief:
>
> - **Concept A:** Throne-focused — the ember throne as the dominant visual with your protagonist silhouetted against it
> - **Concept B:** Character-focused — your blacksmith protagonist front and center with fire in her hands, throne visible in the background
>
> Both will use the dark/epic palette you described (deep reds, oranges, blacks, gold) with cinematic photorealistic rendering and professional typography.
>
> I'll have both concepts ready within 1 business day. Once you see them, you'll pick your favorite and I'll polish it into your final cover.
>
> Starting now!

---

### Scenario B: Incomplete Brief

**CLIENT:**

> Title: The Ember Throne
> Author: Sarah Mitchell
> Genre: Fantasy
> I want it to look cool and epic. Not sure about the rest.

**YOU:**

> Thanks Sarah! I have the basics. Let me ask a few follow-up questions so I can create the strongest concepts possible:
>
> 1. **What's the book about?** Even 2-3 sentences helps me choose the right imagery and mood.
> 2. **Any specific visual elements?** Characters, objects, locations, symbols — anything you'd want on the cover?
> 3. **Reference covers** — Can you send me 2-3 book covers (from Amazon or anywhere) that have the kind of look and feel you'd want? This is the fastest way for me to understand your taste.
>
> For everything else, I'm happy to make the creative calls — color palette, typography, composition. I do this daily and I'll make sure it reads well at Amazon thumbnail size.
>
> Just send me those 3 things and I'll get started.

---

### Scenario C: Client Sends Assets or Existing Art

**CLIENT:**

> I already had someone create some concept art for the main character. Can you use this?

**YOU:**

> Absolutely — send it over. I'll use it as a visual reference for the character's appearance, pose, and style.
>
> Just to be clear: I'll be creating the cover from scratch using my own creative pipeline, not editing or compositing the existing art. But having a reference for how you see the character is extremely helpful for accuracy.
>
> Send the image along with your completed creative brief and I'll incorporate it into both concepts.

---

## Phase 4: Concept Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi Sarah! Your 2 concepts are ready.
>
> **Concept A — "Throne Focus"** > [Image attached]
> The ember throne dominates the composition — cracking and glowing with living fire. Your protagonist is silhouetted in the foreground, reaching toward the throne. Deep red and gold palette, dramatic backlighting.
>
> **Concept B — "Character Focus"** > [Image attached]
> Sarah's blacksmith protagonist is front and center, fire swirling around her hands. The crumbling castle is visible in the misty background. Warmer orange tones, more intimate and character-driven.
>
> Both have placeholder typography — once you pick your favorite, I'll apply the final professional typography treatment.
>
> **What to do next:**
>
> 1. Pick Concept A or Concept B (or tell me you love elements from both and I'll combine them)
> 2. Tell me any changes you'd like — this is your 1 included revision round
>
> Take your time looking at them!

---

## Phase 5: Revision Round

### Scenario A: Client Picks One, Requests Changes

**CLIENT:**

> I love Concept A! But can you make the throne glow brighter and make the title text bigger?

**YOU:**

> Great choice! I'll make both adjustments:
>
> - Intensify the ember glow on the throne — more brightness and heat shimmer
> - Increase the title text size for stronger impact at thumbnail size
>
> I'll have the revised version ready within a few hours. This is your included revision round, so if there's anything else you'd like adjusted — colors, text placement, composition — now's the time to mention it.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants to Combine Elements

**CLIENT:**

> Can I have the throne from Concept A but the character pose from Concept B?

**YOU:**

> Absolutely — that's a common request and a great instinct. I'll merge the throne-dominant background from Concept A with the character-forward pose from Concept B. Same palette and mood.
>
> This counts as your included revision round, so let me know if there's anything else you'd like adjusted while I'm working on this version — text, colors, composition, anything.
>
> I'll have the merged version ready within a few hours.

---

### Scenario C: Client Doesn't Like Either Concept

**CLIENT:**

> These aren't really what I had in mind. Can we try something completely different?

**YOU:**

> I appreciate the honesty — I'd rather get it right than have you settle.
>
> Can you help me understand what's not working? Specifically:
>
> 1. Is it the **composition/layout**? (what's in the image and where)
> 2. Is it the **style/mood**? (the colors, lighting, atmosphere)
> 3. Is it the **subject matter**? (the wrong scene or elements)
>
> If you can point me to what you're envisioning — even a rough description or a reference image that's closer — I'll use your included revision round to create a new direction.
>
> If after the revision you'd like additional rounds, those are available at $75 each (Cover Minor Revision) or $250 for a completely new concept direction (Cover Major Revision).

---

### Scenario D: Client Is Happy, No Changes

**CLIENT:**

> Concept B is perfect! I don't need any changes.

**YOU:**

> Excellent! I'll apply the final typography treatment — professional font selection, title hierarchy, author name placement — and do a final polish pass on colors and composition.
>
> Your final cover will be ready within a few hours. You'll receive:
>
> - High-resolution PNG (1600x2400, 300 DPI)
> - High-resolution JPG (1600x2400, 300 DPI)
>
> Both files ready for Amazon KDP upload — Kindle and paperback.

---

## Phase 6: Final Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi Sarah! Your final cover is complete.
>
> **"The Ember Throne" — Final Cover** > [Image attached]
>
> **Delivered files:**
>
> - `The-Ember-Throne-Cover-FINAL.png` (1600x2400, 300 DPI)
> - `The-Ember-Throne-Cover-FINAL.jpg` (1600x2400, 300 DPI)
>
> **Files delivered via:** Google Drive link / ZIP attachment
>
> **How to use:**
>
> - **Kindle:** Upload the PNG or JPG directly as your ebook cover in KDP
> - **KDP Print Paperback:** Upload as the front cover image, then use Amazon's Cover Creator to add spine and back cover
>
> Please download and verify everything looks correct. If you spot any issues — typos, color shifts, anything — let me know and I'll fix them immediately.
>
> It's been a pleasure working on this! If you're happy with the result, I'd really appreciate a review on Reedsy — it helps other authors find me. And if you publish more books, returning clients get 10% off.

---

## Phase 7: Post-Delivery Scenarios

### Scenario A: Client Spots a Typo or Minor Error

**CLIENT:**

> The cover looks amazing but my last name is spelled wrong — it should be "Mitchell" not "Mitchel"

**YOU:**

> My apologies! I'll fix that right now and send updated files within the hour. No charge — that's on me.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants Additional Changes After Final Delivery

**CLIENT:**

> I love the cover, but now I'm thinking the subtitle should be different. Can you change it?

**YOU:**

> Of course! Since the final has been delivered and your included revision round is used, this would be a Cover Minor Revision at $75. That covers any text change, color adjustment, or subtitle update.
>
> Want me to go ahead? I can have it done within 1 business day.

---

### Scenario C: Client Wants a Completely New Direction After Delivery

**CLIENT:**

> I showed it to my editor and they think we should go in a totally different direction. Can we start over?

**YOU:**

> I understand — feedback from editors can change everything. There are two options:
>
> 1. **Cover Major Revision — $250:** I create a new concept in a different style or direction, with a fresh visual approach.
> 2. **New Standard Package — $450:** If it's a completely clean start with a new brief, new concepts, new everything.
>
> Which feels more appropriate? If the core elements (title, genre, palette) are staying the same but the visual direction is changing, the Major Revision at $250 is the right move.

---

### Scenario D: Client Asks for More Books / Upsell Opportunity

**CLIENT:**

> This is great! I actually have 2 more books in this series. Can you do those too?

**YOU:**

> Absolutely! For a 3-book series, I'd recommend the Series Branding — Starter package ($1,400). It includes:
>
> - 3 front covers (visually consistent across the series)
> - Series logo
> - Box set front cover
> - 1 revision round
>
> Since you already have the first cover, I can match the new covers to your existing design. That's $1,400 for the full package, or $350 each as individual Add New Book Cover updates.
>
> The branding package is the better value and ensures all 3 covers look like they belong together. Want me to send the creative brief for the series?

---

### Scenario E: Client Leaves a Review

**CLIENT:**

> Just left you a 5-star review! Thanks again.

**YOU:**

> Thank you so much, Sarah! That means a lot — reviews are everything for a new studio. I hope "The Ember Throne" does amazing on Amazon. Don't hesitate to reach out when you're ready for the next book. Returning clients always get 10% off!

---

## Reedsy Payment Notes

- **Payment on Reedsy:** The client pays through the Reedsy platform. Reedsy takes a 10% commission. On a $450 package, you receive $405.
- **Alternative:** If the client found you on Reedsy but wants to pay directly, you can direct them to https://metronagon.com/services to pay via Stripe (no commission). However, this must be handled carefully — Reedsy's terms require that projects initiated on the platform are completed and paid through the platform.
- **Milestone structure:** For a $450 single-cover project, Reedsy typically handles this as a single milestone (100% upfront or on delivery, depending on your agreement with the client).

---

## Follow-Up Template (If Client Goes Silent)

If the client hasn't responded in 3 days after any stage:

**YOU:**

> Hi Sarah! Just checking in — wanted to make sure you received everything and see if you have any questions. No rush, just want to make sure nothing fell through the cracks. Let me know whenever you're ready to continue!

If no response after 7 days:

**YOU:**

> Hi Sarah — following up one more time. I have your project queued and ready to continue whenever you are. If your plans have changed, no worries at all — just let me know. Otherwise, I'm here when you're ready!
