---

## Phase 1: Initial Inquiry

### Scenario A: Client Wants Everything in One Package

**CLIENT:**

> Hi, I'm launching a 3-book series and I need covers, a logo, a box set cover, AND book descriptions for Amazon. Do you offer a bundle?

**YOU:**

> Hi! That's exactly what my Full Pipeline — Starter package is built for. It's $550 and includes everything you need to launch a 3-book series on Amazon:
>
> - 3 visually consistent front covers (Kindle + paperback ready, 1600x2400, 300 DPI)
> - Series logo (logomark + wordmark)
> - Box set front cover
> - 3 keyword-optimized Amazon book descriptions — compelling hooks designed to drive conversions
> - 1 round of revisions on any deliverable
> - 2 business day delivery
>
> This is the same as my Series Branding Starter ($400) but with Amazon book descriptions included — saving you the cost and hassle of hiring a separate copywriter.
>
> I've published 22 books across 3 series on Amazon, so I write descriptions that actually convert because I know how Amazon shoppers browse and buy.
>
> Want to move forward? I'll send you the creative brief.

---

### Scenario B: Client Comparing Pipeline vs Branding

**CLIENT:**

> What's the difference between your Series Branding ($400) and Full Pipeline ($550) for 3 books?

**YOU:**

> Simple — the Full Pipeline adds **Amazon book descriptions** to everything in the branding package:
>
> | Feature                    | Series Branding ($400) | Full Pipeline ($550) |
> | -------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
> | 3 front covers             | Yes                    | Yes                  |
> | Series logo                | Yes                    | Yes                  |
> | Box set front cover        | Yes                    | Yes                  |
> | 3 Amazon book descriptions | No                     | **Yes**              |
> | Revision rounds            | 1                      | 1                    |
> | Delivery                   | 2 days                 | 2 days               |
>
> The $150 difference gets you 3 professionally written, keyword-optimized book descriptions — each one designed as a conversion hook for Amazon shoppers. That's $50 per description, which is well below what a standalone copywriter would charge on Reedsy.
>
> If you already have descriptions written or plan to write them yourself, the Branding package is fine. If you want everything done for you in one go, Pipeline is the better value.

---

### Scenario C: Client Asks About the Book Descriptions

**CLIENT:**

> What exactly are the "book descriptions"? Like the blurb on Amazon?

**YOU:**

> Exactly — it's the product description that appears on your Amazon book listing page. This is one of the most important sales tools for your book.
>
> What I write for you:
>
> - **Keyword-optimized** — I research relevant Amazon search terms for your genre and weave them naturally into the description
> - **Conversion-focused** — Written with a hook, stakes, and a call to action. The goal is to turn a browser into a buyer.
> - **Amazon-formatted** — Properly structured with bold text, line breaks, and pacing that works in Amazon's product description format
>
> Each description is typically 150-250 words — long enough to sell the book, short enough to keep attention.
>
> I've written descriptions for all 22 of my published Amazon books, so I know the format inside and out.

---

### Scenario D: Client Hasn't Written the Books Yet

**CLIENT:**

> I haven't finished writing the books yet. Can I still get the covers and descriptions?

**YOU:**

> Covers — absolutely. I design covers from your creative brief (genre, mood, visual direction), not from the finished manuscript.
>
> Descriptions — I need enough to write a compelling blurb. Specifically:
>
> - A 3-5 sentence summary of each book's plot or concept
> - The main character(s) and their central conflict
> - The genre and target reader
>
> I don't need the finished book. I need enough story information to write a description that hooks the right reader. Many authors commission covers and descriptions before finishing their manuscript — it's standard practice for building pre-launch momentum.
>
> Want to proceed? I'll send the brief.

---

## AI Transparency & Client Consent (Reedsy Compliance — Required)

> **This disclosure must be sent BEFORE proceeding to the creative brief. Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, you must obtain the client's written consent before any AI-assisted tools are used in the project.**

After the client expresses interest and before sending the creative brief, send the following:

**YOU:**

> Before we move forward, I want to be fully transparent about my creative process — I share this with every client upfront, and Reedsy requires it.
>
> My design workflow uses **AI-assisted image generation** as a core part of the creative pipeline for all visual deliverables. I use advanced prompt engineering techniques to generate high-quality visual concepts, which I then refine, composite, color-grade, and finalize into production-ready cover art and visual assets.
>
> **What this means in practice for your visual deliverables (covers, logo, box set):**
>
> - I translate your creative brief into detailed, genre-specific image generation prompts — each one carefully engineered to capture your series' characters, setting, mood, and genre conventions
> - Each concept goes through multiple rounds of generation, selection, and refinement — I generate dozens of variations and curate the strongest results
> - I composite, color-grade, and enhance the selected outputs to achieve a cohesive, polished visual system across all covers in your series
> - Typography, layout, logo design, and final production are handled with professional design precision
> - Every visual deliverable is a polished, commercially ready, print-quality product — not a raw AI output
>
> **A note on your Amazon book descriptions:** The keyword-optimized book descriptions included in this package are **written work** — crafted by me based on your story details, genre keywords, and conversion principles. The AI transparency above applies specifically to the visual deliverables (covers, series logo, box set cover).
>
> **What this does NOT mean:**
>
> - This is not "type a sentence and use the first thing that appears." Every visual goes through an extensive creative process driven by my expertise in book cover design, genre conventions, and Amazon marketplace requirements.
> - I've published 22 books across 3 series on Amazon — all designed using this exact pipeline. Maintaining visual consistency across an entire series is where this process truly shines.
>
> **Please take a look at my portfolio to see the quality this process delivers:**
>
> - https://metronagon.com/ai-transparency — full details on my AI-assisted process, copyright protections, and a real example prompt
> - https://metronagon.com/examples — cover gallery across multiple genres
> - https://metronagon.com/case-studies — complete series case studies showing visual consistency across multiple books
>
> Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, I need your written confirmation that you're comfortable with AI-assisted tools being part of the creative process for the visual deliverables before we proceed.
>
> Happy to answer any questions about how it works.

### Client Response: Accepts

**CLIENT:**

> That's totally fine with me. Your portfolio looks great — let's go!

**YOU:**

> Thank you — I appreciate both the trust and the chance to work on this. I'll note your consent in our project record and send you the creative brief next.

---

### Client Response: Has Questions About Quality / Uniqueness

**CLIENT:**

> I'm open to it, but I want to make sure my covers won't look "AI-generated" or generic. How do you ensure quality?

**YOU:**

> Completely fair concern, and one I take seriously. Here's how I deliver professional-grade results:
>
> 1. **Your brief drives every prompt.** I don't use templates or generic inputs. Every image generation prompt is custom-built from YOUR specific characters, settings, mood, color palette, and genre.
> 2. **Iterative refinement.** I generate dozens of variations per concept, then select, composite, and refine the strongest elements — it's a curation and design process, not a one-shot output.
> 3. **Series consistency.** This is where my process excels — I engineer prompts that maintain the same visual language, color palette, and compositional logic across every book in your series.
> 4. **Professional finishing.** Typography, composition, color grading, and production polish are all applied with the same rigor as any professional design workflow.
> 5. **Genre expertise.** I know what works on Amazon because I sell there myself. Your covers will look like they belong on a bestseller shelf.
>
> And remember — the book descriptions are written by me from scratch based on your story details and genre keywords. No AI generation there — just conversion-focused copywriting from someone who's written descriptions for 22 Amazon titles.
>
> Check my case studies for proof: https://metronagon.com/case-studies — you'll see complete series with consistent visual identity across multiple books. That level of design intention doesn't happen by accident.
>
> If you're comfortable, just confirm and I'll send the creative brief!

---

### Client Response: Has Copyright Concerns

**CLIENT:**

> I've read that AI-generated images can't be copyrighted. Will that be a problem for my covers?

**YOU:**

> Important question — and one I take very seriously as a professional.
>
> You're right that the US Copyright Office has indicated that purely AI-generated images with minimal human input may lack full copyright protection on their own. However, my workflow involves substantial human creative direction at every stage: concept development, detailed prompt engineering, visual selection, compositing, refinement, typography, layout, and production design.
>
> The final products you receive are not raw AI outputs — they're professionally designed covers that reflect significant human creative decision-making throughout the entire process.
>
> As a Reedsy professional, I bear full legal responsibility for ensuring that your deliverables are commercially exploitable and free of copyright issues. That's my obligation to you, and I stand behind it completely.
>
> You'll receive production-ready files that you can use commercially on Amazon, IngramSpark, or any other publishing platform without restriction.
>
> As for the book descriptions — those are original written work and are fully copyrightable without question.

---

### Client Response: Declines AI-Assisted Work

**CLIENT:**

> I appreciate the honesty, but I'd prefer a designer who works without AI tools. Nothing personal.

**YOU:**

> No offense taken at all — I genuinely respect that preference, and I'd always rather be upfront than surprise you later.
>
> I'd suggest browsing Reedsy's other designers who specialize in hand-illustrated or traditional digital painting approaches. If you ever want to see what my pipeline can deliver, my portfolio is always open: https://metronagon.com/examples
>
> Best of luck with your series!

---

## Phase 2: Creative Brief Request

**YOU:**

> Here's the creative brief for the Full Pipeline. This covers both the visual work (covers, logo, box set) AND the book descriptions, so there are a few more questions than a branding-only package.
>
> **CREATIVE BRIEF — Full Pipeline (3 Books)**
>
> **1. Series Overview**
>
> - Series name (if you have one):
> - Genre:
> - Brief series description (3-5 sentences about the overall story arc):

>
> **2. Individual Book Details (for each of the 3 books)**
>
> _Book 1:_
>
> - Title (and subtitle, if any):
> - Brief description (3-5 sentences — what happens in this book? Include the main conflict, stakes, and hook):
> - Main character(s) — Who are they, what do they want, what's stopping them?
> - Key visual element or scene for the cover:
>
> _Book 2:_
>
> - Title:
> - Brief description (3-5 sentences):
> - Main character(s) / character development from Book 1:
> - Key visual element or scene:
>
> _Book 3:_
>

> - Key visual element or scene:
>
> **3. Visual Direction (for covers)**
>
> - Mood/tone — What feeling should the series evoke?
> - Color palette preferences:
> - Style preference — Photorealistic or stylized?
> - Key recurring visual element:
>
> **4. Reference Covers**
>
> - 3-5 existing book covers or series you admire:
>
> **5. Logo and Typography**
>
> - Series logo direction — Any ideas, or "your call"?
> - Author name (exactly as it should appear on all covers):
> - Font style preference:
>
> **6. Book Descriptions (additional info)**
>
> - Are there specific keywords or phrases you want included? (e.g., "dark fantasy," "enemies to lovers," "chosen one")
> - Any comparable titles to mention? (e.g., "Fans of [Author] will love...")
> - Tone of the descriptions — Dramatic? Mysterious? Action-packed? Playful?
> - Any content warnings or categories you want highlighted?
>
> **7. Publishing Platform**
>
> - Where will this be published? (Amazon Kindle, KDP Print Paperback, or KDP Print Hardcover?):
> - Amazon categories you're targeting (if known):
>
> The book descriptions require a bit more story detail than covers alone — the richer your book summaries, the stronger the blurbs will be.

---

## Phase 3: Receiving the Brief

### Scenario A: Complete Brief

**CLIENT:**

> Series: The Blood Compass Trilogy
> Genre: Grimdark Fantasy
> Arc: A disgraced cartographer discovers a compass that maps routes written in blood — each path leading to a different warlord's hidden fortress. She sells routes to the highest bidder until the compass starts leading her to a truth she can't sell: the warlords answer to the same shadow.
> Audience: Fans of Joe Abercrombie, Anna Smith Spark, Rob Hayes
>
> Book 1: "The Cartographer's Price"
> Vira, an exiled mapmaker, steals the blood compass from a dead smuggler. First route leads to a warlord's gold vault. She sells the route and becomes the most wanted woman in the Shattered Kingdoms.
> Characters: Vira — cynical, resourceful, morally flexible. Carries the compass on a chain around her neck.
> Cover visual: A woman's hand holding a compass dripping with blood, dark map textures in the background.
>
> Book 2: "The Warlord's Map"
> Vira maps 3 more fortresses but realizes the warlords are connected. A bounty hunter named Kael catches her — but offers a deal instead of a blade. Together they map the network.
> Characters: Vira + Kael (scarred, pragmatic, dangerous alliance).
> Cover visual: A blood-red map with fortress markers connected by dark lines, the compass at the center.
>
> Book 3: "The Shadow Route"
> The final route leads to the shadow behind the warlords — an ancient power that has been guiding the compass all along. Vira must destroy the compass or become the next warlord.
> Cover visual: The compass shattered, dark tendrils reaching from its fragments, Vira silhouetted against a burning fortress.
>
> Mood: Dark, tense, morally gray, gritty
> Colors: Deep crimson, blacks, aged parchment tones, gold accents
> Style: Photorealistic, cinematic
> Recurring element: The blood compass
> References: [links]
> Logo: Something incorporating compass/map imagery
> Author: Rhea Voss
> Font: Serif, weathered/aged feel
> Keywords: "grimdark fantasy," "morally gray protagonist," "dark fantasy series," "epic fantasy adventure"
> Comparable: "For fans of Joe Abercrombie's First Law and Anna Smith Spark's Empires of Dust"
> Description tone: Dark, tense, hook-driven
> Platform: Kindle + KDP Print Paperback
> Categories: Dark Fantasy, Epic Fantasy, Grimdark

**YOU:**

> Rhea, this is an incredible concept. "The Blood Compass Trilogy" is going to look and read like a series that belongs at the top of Amazon's Dark Fantasy category. Here's my plan:
>
> **Design System:**
>
> - Palette: Deep crimson, blacks, aged parchment tones, gold metallic accents
> - The blood compass appears on every cover as the visual anchor
> - Progression: Book 1 (intimate/discovery) → Book 2 (expansion/conspiracy) → Book 3 (destruction/climax)
> - Weathered serif typography with aged texture, consistent logo placement
>
> **Cover Plan:**
>
> - **Book 1:** Hand holding the blood-dripping compass over dark map textures. Tight, intimate, noir.
> - **Book 2:** Blood-red map with connected fortress markers, compass at center. Wider scope, conspiracy revealed.
> - **Book 3:** Shattered compass, dark tendrils, Vira silhouetted against a burning fortress. Epic, destructive, final.
>
> **Series Logo:** "The Blood Compass" wordmark with compass rose integrated, weathered texture.
>
> **Box Set Cover:** The compass at center, the three cover scenes swirling around it like a map being drawn in blood.
>
> **Book Descriptions:** Three grimdark-toned blurbs — hook-first, stakes-driven, genre-keyword-rich. Each one ending with a cliffhanger hook or a "read or die" urgency that grimdark readers love. I'll weave in "grimdark fantasy," "morally gray protagonist," and the Abercrombie/Smith Spark comp naturally.
>
> I'll deliver everything within 2 business days. Starting now!

## Phase 4: Deliverables Delivery

**YOU:**

> **Book 1 — "The Cartographer's Price"**
>
> > _The compass maps routes in blood. Each one leads to power. Each one has a price._
> >
> > Vira was the finest cartographer in the Shattered Kingdoms — until the crown exiled her for mapping secrets that were meant to stay buried. Now she survives by selling what she knows to anyone who pays.
> >
> > When she pulls a strange compass from a dead smuggler's coat, everything changes. The compass doesn't point north. It points to **hidden places** — vaults, fortresses, routes that no living person should know.
> >
> > Her first route leads to a warlord's gold. Her second leads to another warlord's armory. By the third, she's the most wanted woman in the Kingdoms — and the most valuable.
> >
> > But the compass keeps mapping. And the routes are getting darker.
> >
> > **The Cartographer's Price** is the first book in The Blood Compass Trilogy — a grimdark fantasy for fans of Joe Abercrombie and Anna Smith Spark. If you like morally gray protagonists, high-stakes political intrigue, and dark worlds where survival comes at a cost, this series will pull you in and never let go.

> ---
>
> **Book 2 — "The Warlord's Map"**
>
> > [Full description in same style — conspiracy, Kael alliance, expanding stakes]
>
> ---
>
> **Book 3 — "The Shadow Route"**

> > [Full description — climax, the shadow behind the warlords, Vira's final choice]
>
> ---
>
> **What to do next:**
>
> 1. Review all deliverables — covers, logo, box set, and all 3 descriptions
> 2. For covers: check visual consistency, titles, author name
> 3. For descriptions: check accuracy, tone, keywords, and that nothing reveals too much
> 4. List ALL changes in one message — this is your 1 included revision round covering everything
>
> Take your time!

---

## Phase 5: Revision Round

### Scenario A: Cover Changes + Description Edits

**CLIENT:**

> Covers are amazing! Logo and box set are perfect. But:
>
> - Book 2 cover: Can the map be more prominent? It feels like background noise.
> - Description 1: Love it, but change "crown exiled her" to "guild expelled her" — that's more accurate to the plot
> - Description 3: The ending hook feels too vague. Can you make it punchier?

**YOU:**

> Great feedback! I'll address all three:
>
> 1. Book 2 cover — Make the blood map the dominant visual element: larger, sharper, more central
> 2. Description 1 — Change "crown exiled her" → "guild expelled her"
> 3. Description 3 — Sharpen the final hook: more specific stakes, more urgency, punchier final line
>
> This is your included revision round — covers and descriptions are both covered. I'll deliver everything together.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants Descriptions Rewritten

**CLIENT:**

> The covers are perfect but the descriptions don't feel right. Can we take a different approach? Less dramatic, more mysterious.

**YOU:**

> Absolutely. I'll rewrite all 3 descriptions with a more mysterious, restrained tone — less "grimdark action" and more "what's really going on?" Let the reader wonder rather than telling them.
>
> Same keywords and genre positioning, just a different emotional angle. I'll deliver the rewritten descriptions along with any other changes you want (this is your 1 included revision round).
>
> Any specific lines or phrases you liked from the first drafts that I should keep?

---

### Scenario C: Client Wants to Add Keywords

**CLIENT:**

> Can you add "enemies to lovers" to the Book 2 description? I want to attract romance crossover readers.

**YOU:**

> Smart move for crossover discovery. I'll weave "enemies to lovers" naturally into the Book 2 description — probably in the Kael introduction section where the "dangerous alliance" forms. It'll read as organic, not forced.
>
> Any other keyword additions across the 3 descriptions?

---

## Phase 6: Final Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi Rhea! Your complete Full Pipeline package is finalized.
>
> **Final Delivery — The Blood Compass Trilogy**
>
> **Covers (PNG + JPG, 1600x2400, 300 DPI each):**
>
> - `The-Cartographers-Price-Cover-FINAL.png / .jpg`
> - `The-Warlords-Map-Cover-FINAL.png / .jpg`
> - `The-Shadow-Route-Cover-FINAL.png / .jpg`
>
> **Series Logo:**
>
> - `Blood-Compass-Logo.png` (transparent background)
> - `Blood-Compass-Logo-Dark.png` (for light backgrounds)
>
> **Box Set Cover:**
>
> - `Blood-Compass-Trilogy-BoxSet-FINAL.png / .jpg`
>
> **Amazon Book Descriptions:**
>
> - `Book-Descriptions.docx` — All 3 descriptions formatted and ready to copy-paste into KDP
> - Each description includes: HTML-formatted version (for Amazon's backend) and plain text version
>
> **Files delivered via:** Google Drive link (organized: /Covers, /Logo, /BoxSet, /Descriptions)
>
> **How to use the descriptions:**
>
> - In KDP, go to your book's listing → Book Description
> - Copy the HTML version for best formatting (bold, line breaks, etc.)
> - Or paste the plain text version and format manually in Amazon's editor
>
> Please verify everything. For descriptions: read them aloud to check flow, and confirm no plot spoilers.
>
> The Blood Compass Trilogy is going to crush it on Amazon. A Reedsy review would mean everything — and returning clients get 10% off!

---

## Phase 7: Post-Delivery Scenarios

### Scenario A: Client Wants to Update Descriptions Later

**CLIENT:**

> I published Book 1 and want to update the description based on reader feedback. Can you rewrite it?

**YOU:**

> Of course! That's a Book Description Update at $35. I'll revise the description based on your feedback — new keywords, different hook, adjusted tone, whatever you need. 1 business day delivery.
>
> As a returning client, you get 10% off: **$31.50**.
>
> Send me what you want changed and I'll handle it.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants to Expand to 5 Books

**CLIENT:**

> I'm extending the series to 5 books. Can you do covers + descriptions for the 2 new ones?

**YOU:**

> Great news! Two options:
>
> 1. **2x Add New Book Cover ($125 each) + 2x Book Description ($35 each) = $320**
>
> 2. **Upgrade to Full Pipeline Standard (5 Books) at $850.** Since you've already paid $550, the upgrade is $300 and includes: 5 covers total, logo (already done), box set cover (updated for 5 books), and 5 descriptions.
>
> The upgrade at $300 is slightly cheaper than a la carte ($320) AND you get an updated box set cover included. Better deal.
>
> Want to proceed with the upgrade?

---

### Scenario C: Client Asks for A+ Content

**CLIENT:**

> My book is doing well and I want to create Amazon A+ Content. Can you help?

**YOU:**

> A+ Content (enhanced product descriptions with images) isn't part of my standard packages, but I can create A+ Content graphics as a custom project. This would include:
>
> - Author bio banner
> - Series overview graphic
> - Book comparison chart
> - Quote/review highlights
>
> Contact me at hello@metronagon.com and I'll put together a custom quote based on what you need.

## Follow-Up Template (If Client Goes Silent)

After 3 days:

**YOU:**

> Hi Rhea! Just checking in — wanted to see if you've had a chance to review everything. Your revision round covers both the covers and descriptions, so don't hesitate to send feedback on any piece. No rush!

After 7 days:

**YOU:**

> Hi Rhea — one more check-in. All your files are saved and the revision round is still active. Whenever you're ready, just send feedback and I'll jump right on it. If plans have changed, no worries at all!
