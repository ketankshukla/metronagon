**Price:** $600

---

## Phase 1: Initial Inquiry

### Scenario A: Client Has a 5-Book Series Planned

**CLIENT:**

> Hi, I'm planning a 5-book urban fantasy series and need covers for all of them. What do you offer for series work?

**YOU:**

> Hi! A 5-book series is the sweet spot for visual branding — enough books to build a recognizable identity on Amazon.
>
> My Series Branding — Standard package is $600 for 5 books:
>
> - 5 visually consistent front covers (Kindle + paperback ready, 1600x2400, 300 DPI)
> - Series logo (logomark + wordmark)
> - Box set front cover (for your Amazon box set listing)
> - 1 round of revisions on any deliverable
> - 2 business day delivery
>
> Every cover shares a unified color palette, typography system, and composition logic — so readers instantly recognize your books as a series when browsing Amazon thumbnails.
>
> I've designed covers for three complete series on Amazon (22 books total), including a 12-book series where visual consistency was critical for driving binge reads.
>
> Want to get started? I can send you the creative brief.

---

### Scenario B: Client Comparing Package Sizes

**CLIENT:**

> I have 5 books but I'm not sure if I should do the 3-book starter or the 5-book standard. Can I start with 3 and add 2 later?

**YOU:**

> You can, but it's more expensive a la carte. Here's the math:
>
> **Option 1: Start with 3-book Starter ($400) + add 2 covers later ($125 each = $250) = $650 total**
> You'd also miss the box set cover update for the 5-book set.
>
> **Option 2: 5-book Standard ($600)**
> All 5 covers designed as a unified system from day one + logo + box set cover — $50 less than doing it piecemeal.
>
> The 5-book package is the better value AND produces a more cohesive result because I design all 5 together. The consistency is strongest when the entire set is created in one session.
>
> If budget is the concern, I understand — the 3-book starter is a great starting point. But if you know it's going to be 5 books, the Standard is the right call.

---

### Scenario C: Client Asks About Per-Cover Cost

**CLIENT:**

> $600 for 5 covers — that's $120 per cover. Could I just buy individual covers at $150 each?

**YOU:**

> You could — 5 individual Standard covers would be $750. So the branding package saves you $150 right off the top.
>
> But the real value isn't just the per-cover savings:
>
> 1. **Visual consistency** — All 5 covers are designed as a unified system. Same palette, typography, composition logic. Individual covers designed separately may not look cohesive as a set.
> 2. **Series logo included** — A custom logomark and wordmark that anchors the brand of your series. This would be $100+ as a standalone.
> 3. **Box set cover included** — A front cover for your Amazon box set listing, showcasing all 5 books as a single product. Another $100+ standalone.
>
> So you're getting 5 covers + logo + box set for $600, vs. 5 covers alone for $750. The branding package is clearly the better deal.

## AI Transparency & Client Consent (Reedsy Compliance — Required)

> **This disclosure must be sent BEFORE proceeding to the creative brief. Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, you must obtain the client's written consent before any AI-assisted tools are used in the project.**

After the client expresses interest and before sending the creative brief, send the following:

**YOU:**

> Before we move forward, I want to be fully transparent about my creative process — I share this with every client upfront, and Reedsy requires it.
>
> My design workflow uses **AI-assisted image generation** as a core part of the creative pipeline. I use advanced prompt engineering techniques to generate high-quality visual concepts, which I then refine, composite, color-grade, and finalize into production-ready cover art and visual assets.
>
> **What this means in practice:**
>
> - I translate your creative brief into detailed, genre-specific image generation prompts — each one carefully engineered to capture your series' characters, setting, mood, and genre conventions
> - Each concept goes through multiple rounds of generation, selection, and refinement — I generate dozens of variations and curate the strongest results
> - I composite, color-grade, and enhance the selected outputs to achieve a cohesive, polished visual system across all covers in your series
> - Typography, layout, logo design, and final production are handled with professional design precision
> - Every deliverable — covers, series logo, and box set cover — is a polished, commercially ready, print-quality product
>
> **What this does NOT mean:**
>
> - This is not "type a sentence and use the first thing that appears." Every visual goes through an extensive creative process driven by my expertise in book cover design, genre conventions, and Amazon marketplace requirements.
> - I've published 22 books across 3 series on Amazon — all designed using this exact pipeline. Maintaining visual consistency across an entire series is where this process truly shines.
>
> **Please take a look at my portfolio to see the quality this process delivers:**
>
> - https://metronagon.com/ai-transparency — full details on my AI-assisted process, copyright protections, and a real example prompt
> - https://metronagon.com/examples — cover gallery across multiple genres
> - https://metronagon.com/case-studies — complete series case studies showing visual consistency across multiple books
>
> Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, I need your written confirmation that you're comfortable with AI-assisted tools being part of the creative process before we proceed.
>
> Happy to answer any questions about how it works.

### Client Response: Accepts

**CLIENT:**

> That's totally fine with me. Your portfolio looks great — let's go!

**YOU:**

> Thank you — I appreciate both the trust and the chance to work on this. I'll note your consent in our project record and send you the creative brief next.

---

### Client Response: Has Questions About Quality / Uniqueness

**CLIENT:**

> I'm open to it, but I want to make sure my covers won't look "AI-generated" or generic. How do you ensure quality?

**YOU:**

> Completely fair concern, and one I take seriously. Here's how I deliver professional-grade results:
>
> 1. **Your brief drives every prompt.** I don't use templates or generic inputs. Every image generation prompt is custom-built from YOUR specific characters, settings, mood, color palette, and genre.
> 2. **Iterative refinement.** I generate dozens of variations per concept, then select, composite, and refine the strongest elements — it's a curation and design process, not a one-shot output.
> 3. **Series consistency.** This is where my process excels — I engineer prompts that maintain the same visual language, color palette, and compositional logic across every book in your series.
> 4. **Professional finishing.** Typography, composition, color grading, and production polish are all applied with the same rigor as any professional design workflow.
> 5. **Genre expertise.** I know what works on Amazon because I sell there myself. Your covers will look like they belong on a bestseller shelf.
>
> Check my case studies for proof: https://metronagon.com/case-studies — you'll see complete series with consistent visual identity across multiple books. That level of design intention doesn't happen by accident.
>
> If you're comfortable, just confirm and I'll send the creative brief!

---

### Client Response: Has Copyright Concerns

**CLIENT:**

> I've read that AI-generated images can't be copyrighted. Will that be a problem for my covers?

**YOU:**

> Important question — and one I take very seriously as a professional.
>
> You're right that the US Copyright Office has indicated that purely AI-generated images with minimal human input may lack full copyright protection on their own. However, my workflow involves substantial human creative direction at every stage: concept development, detailed prompt engineering, visual selection, compositing, refinement, typography, layout, and production design.
>
> The final products you receive are not raw AI outputs — they're professionally designed covers that reflect significant human creative decision-making throughout the entire process.
>
> As a Reedsy professional, I bear full legal responsibility for ensuring that your deliverables are commercially exploitable and free of copyright issues. That's my obligation to you, and I stand behind it completely.
>
> You'll receive production-ready files that you can use commercially on Amazon, IngramSpark, or any other publishing platform without restriction.

---

### Client Response: Declines AI-Assisted Work

**CLIENT:**

> I appreciate the honesty, but I'd prefer a designer who works without AI tools. Nothing personal.

**YOU:**

> No offense taken at all — I genuinely respect that preference, and I'd always rather be upfront than surprise you later.
>
> I'd suggest browsing Reedsy's other designers who specialize in hand-illustrated or traditional digital painting approaches. If you ever want to see what my pipeline can deliver, my portfolio is always open: https://metronagon.com/examples
>
> Best of luck with your series!

---

## Phase 2: Creative Brief Request

**YOU:**

> Here's the creative brief for your 5-book series. I need details for each book so I can create covers that tell a visual story across the series while each standing strong on its own.

## Phase 3: Receiving the Brief

### Scenario A: Complete Brief

**CLIENT:**

> Series: The Veil Walkers
> Genre: Urban Fantasy / Paranormal
> Arc: Mara discovers she can cross between the human world and the spirit realm through tears in reality called "veils." Each book follows her deeper into the spirit world as she uncovers a conspiracy that threatens both realms.
> Audience: Fans of Patricia Briggs, Ilona Andrews, Kevin Hearne
>
> Book 1: "Thin Places" — Mara accidentally crosses the veil and meets her first spirit guide. Discovery, wonder, danger.
> Visual: A woman stepping through a glowing tear in reality — one foot in a city street, one foot in a spirit forest.
>
> Book 2: "The Other Side" — Mara learns the rules of the spirit realm. Training, alliances, first real threat.
> Visual: Mara in the spirit realm, surrounded by ethereal beings and strange landscapes.
>
> Book 3: "Veil Sickness" — The boundary is weakening. Spirits are crossing into the human world. Horror elements.
> Visual: A city street where reality is cracking — spirit creatures seeping through fractures in the air.
>
> Book 4: "The Hollow" — Mara enters the deepest layer of the spirit realm. Lost, alone, desperate.
> Visual: A vast, dark void with distant lights — Mara small against an enormous, alien landscape.
>
> Book 5: "Veil Walker" — The finale. Mara must seal the boundary forever or merge the two worlds.
> Visual: Mara standing between both worlds, holding them apart/together, energy flowing through her.
>
> Mood: Mysterious, atmospheric, increasingly dark. Books 1-2 are wonder-driven, 3-4 get darker, 5 is epic.
> Colors: Deep teals, purples, silver/white light. Warm amber for the human world, cool blue/silver for the spirit world.
> Style: Photorealistic with atmospheric/ethereal effects
> Recurring element: The veil — a glowing tear or fracture in reality
> Visual progression: Yes — covers should get darker and more intense. Book 1 is the brightest, Book 5 is the most dramatic.
> References: [links]
> Avoid: [links] — too cartoonish, wrong tone
> Logo: Something that incorporates the veil/fracture motif
> Author: Cassandra Drake
> Font: Serif with a slightly ethereal quality
> Platform: Kindle + KDP Print Paperback

**YOU:**

> Cassandra, this is a phenomenal brief. "The Veil Walkers" has a perfect visual arc built right into the story. Here's my plan:
>
> **Design System:**
>
> - Dual palette: Warm amber (human world) and cool teal/silver (spirit world) — the ratio shifts across the series
> - The veil (glowing fracture) appears on every cover as the visual anchor
> - Progressive darkening: Book 1 brightest → Book 5 most dramatic
> - Unified serif typography with ethereal styling, consistent author name and logo placement
>
> **Cover Plan:**
>
> - **Book 1 "Thin Places":** Brightest cover. Mara mid-step through a luminous veil tear — city behind her, spirit forest ahead. Wonder and discovery.
> - **Book 2 "The Other Side":** Spirit realm dominant. Ethereal beings, alien landscapes, silver light. Training and alliance.
> - **Book 3 "Veil Sickness":** City street fracturing — spirit creatures visible through cracks in reality. Horror undertones, warmer palette corrupted.
> - **Book 4 "The Hollow":** Darkest cover. Vast void, distant lights, Mara tiny against the abyss. Isolation and desperation.
> - **Book 5 "Veil Walker":** Most dramatic. Mara between both worlds, energy flowing through her. The veil fully open. Epic, climactic.
>
> **Series Logo:** "The Veil Walkers" wordmark with a fracture/tear motif cutting through the text — the veil itself breaking the letters.
>
> **Box Set Cover:** Both worlds merging into one image with the veil as the central motif, fragments of all 5 cover scenes flowing outward.
>
> I'll deliver everything within 2 business days. Starting now!

---

### Scenario B: Client Has Incomplete Book Plans

**CLIENT:**

> I have solid ideas for Books 1-3 but Books 4 and 5 are still rough. Can we still do this?

**YOU:**

> Absolutely. For Books 4 and 5, give me whatever you have — even just:
>
> - A working title (can change later)
> - The emotional tone (e.g., "darkest book in the series" or "triumphant finale")
> - One key image or setting (e.g., "an underground cave" or "a city in ruins")
>
> That's enough for me to create covers that fit the series arc and can be refined later if your story evolves. The visual system (palette, typography, logo) is locked from Books 1-3, so Books 4-5 will automatically feel cohesive.
>
> If titles or details change after delivery, a text update is just $35 per cover (Cover Minor Revision).

---

## Phase 4: Deliverables Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi Cassandra! Your complete 5-book Series Branding package is ready. Here's everything:

>
> **Book 2 — "The Other Side"** > [Image attached]
> Full spirit realm. Ethereal beings and alien flora surround Mara. Silver light, deep teals and purples. Atmospheric and mysterious.
>
> **Book 3 — "Veil Sickness"** > [Image attached]
> City street fracturing. Spirit creatures visible through cracks in reality — tendrils of the spirit world bleeding into the mundane. Horror-tinged amber and corrupted teal.
>
> **Book 4 — "The Hollow"** > [Image attached]

>

>
> **Box Set Front Cover** > [Image attached]

> **What to do next:**
>

> 2. List ALL changes you'd like in one message — this is your 1 included revision round and it covers any deliverable
> 3. I'll address everything in a single pass
>
> Take your time!

---

## Phase 5: Revision Round

### Scenario A: Targeted Changes Across Multiple Pieces

**CLIENT:**

> These are incredible! A few tweaks:
>
> - Book 3: Can the spirit creatures be more visible? They're a bit subtle.
> - Book 5: Can the energy effect be more dramatic? More light, more power.
> - Logo: Can the fracture effect be slightly wider?
> - Everything else is perfect.

**YOU:**

> Perfect feedback! I'll address all three:
>
> 1. Book 3 — Increase visibility of spirit creatures: more defined forms, stronger glow through the fractures
> 2. Book 5 — Amplify energy effects: brighter cascading light, more dynamic power visualization
> 3. Logo — Widen the fracture effect in the letterforms for more visual impact
>
> All other deliverables remain as-is. This is your included revision round — I'll deliver all updates together within a few hours.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants One Cover Redesigned

**CLIENT:**

> I love 1, 2, 4, and 5 but Book 3 isn't what I envisioned. Can we take a different approach?

**YOU:**

> Of course. What are you envisioning instead? Specifically:
>
> - Is it the composition (what's in the scene)?
> - The mood/color (too dark, too bright, wrong atmosphere)?
> - The subject matter (wrong scene or moment)?
>
> I'll use your revision round to create a new direction for Book 3 while keeping it visually consistent with the other 4 covers. Just describe what you'd prefer and I'll handle it.

---

## Phase 6: Final Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi Cassandra! Your complete Series Branding package is finalized.
>
> **Final Delivery — The Veil Walkers (5 Books)**

> - **Kindle:** Upload each cover PNG/JPG as the ebook cover in KDP
> - **KDP Print:** Upload each as the front cover, use Amazon's Cover Creator for spine and back
> - **Box Set:** Upload for your Amazon box set listing
> - **Logo:** Amazon author page, social media, website, marketing
>
> Please verify everything — check titles, author name, and view all 5 covers side by side to confirm the visual consistency. Also check each cover at thumbnail size (shrink to about 1 inch wide) to see how they'll look on Amazon search results.
>
> Thank you for an incredible project, Cassandra! A Reedsy review would mean a lot. Returning clients always get 10% off future work!

## Phase 7: Post-Delivery Scenarios

### Scenario A: Client Wants to Expand to 10 Books

**CLIENT:**

> The series is doing well and I'm planning 5 more books. Can you do covers 6-10?

**YOU:**

> That's fantastic news! Two options:
>
> 1. **5x Add New Book Cover at $125 each = $625** — Each cover matched to the existing visual system.
>
> 2. **Upgrade to Series Branding Premium (10 Books) at $950** — I'd credit the $600 you already paid, so the upgrade cost is $350 for 5 new covers + updated box set cover. Much better value.
>
> The upgrade is clearly the better deal at $350 for 5 new covers + updated box set. Want to proceed? I'll send the brief for Books 6-10.

---

### Scenario B: Client Needs Updated Box Set Cover

**CLIENT:**

> I'm releasing Books 1-3 as a box set first, then the full 5-book set later. Can I get a 3-book box set cover too?

**YOU:**

> Sure! That would be a New Box Set Front Cover update at $100. I'll create a box set cover featuring just Books 1-3 using the existing visual system. 1 business day delivery.
>
> Want me to go ahead?
