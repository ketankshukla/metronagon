---

## Phase 1: Initial Inquiry

### Scenario A: Client Wants a Print Paperback

**CLIENT:**

> Hi, I want to create a children's picture book and publish it as a paperback on Amazon. What do you offer?

**YOU:**

> Hi! For a print paperback, my Plus package ($700) is the right fit. It includes everything you need for KDP Print:
>
> - 32 fully illustrated pages with consistent character design
> - Front AND back cover illustrations (no spine — Amazon's Cover Creator handles that)
> - Print-ready PDF formatted to KDP Print specifications (bleed, margins, gutter)
> - All page illustrations as individual high-res files
> - 2 rounds of revisions
> - 2 business day delivery
>
> The key difference between Plus and Standard is that Plus gives you the **back cover**, **print-ready formatting**, and **an extra revision round** — all essential for a physical paperback.
>
> You provide the story text, and I create all the artwork. Do you have your story written? I can send you the creative brief to get started.

---

### Scenario B: Client Comparing Standard vs Plus

**CLIENT:**

> What's the difference between Standard ($500) and Plus ($700)?

**YOU:**

> Here's the comparison:
>
> | Feature               | Standard ($500) | Plus ($700)                       |
> | --------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
> | 32 illustrated pages  | Yes             | Yes (enhanced quality)            |
> | Character consistency | Yes             | Yes                               |
> | Front cover           | Yes             | Yes                               |
> | Back cover            | No              | **Yes**                           |
> | PDF format            | Digital-ready   | **Print-ready (KDP Print specs)** |
> | Individual page files | Yes             | Yes                               |
> | Revision rounds       | 1               | **2**                             |
> | Delivery              | 2 days          | 2 days                            |
>
> **Bottom line:**
>
> - **Standard** = Kindle Kids / digital only. Front cover only.
> - **Plus** = Print paperback on Amazon. Front + back covers. Print-ready formatting.
>
> If you're doing a physical paperback, Plus is the package you need. If it's digital-only (Kindle Kids), Standard covers everything.
>
> Which are you planning?

---

### Scenario C: Client Upgrading From Standard

**CLIENT:**

> I bought the Standard package last month and now I want to do a paperback. Can I upgrade to Plus?

**YOU:**

> Absolutely! Since you already have the Standard deliverables, the upgrade to Plus adds:
>
> - Back cover illustration
> - Print-ready PDF reformatted for KDP Print (bleed, margins, gutter)
> - 1 additional revision round
>
> The upgrade cost is $200 (the difference between Standard and Plus). I'll use your existing illustrations and add the print-specific elements.
>
> Want to proceed? I just need your back cover preferences (any text, tagline, or specific imagery you'd like on the back).

---

### Scenario D: Client Asks About Trim Size

**CLIENT:**

> What size will the book be? I want it to be a specific size.

**YOU:**

> I can format to any standard KDP Print trim size. The most common for picture books are:
>
> - **8.5" x 8.5" (square)** — The classic picture book format. Most popular for ages 2-6.
> - **8" x 10" (portrait)** — Taller format, works well for character-focused stories.
> - **10" x 8" (landscape)** — Wider format, great for panoramic scenes and environments.
>
> The square format is my default recommendation — it's what most readers expect for a children's picture book. But I'll format to whatever size you prefer.
>
> Which do you want? If you're unsure, go with 8.5" x 8.5" square.

---

## AI Transparency & Client Consent (Reedsy Compliance — Required)

> **This disclosure must be sent BEFORE proceeding to the creative brief. Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, you must obtain the client's written consent before any AI-assisted tools are used in the project.**

After the client expresses interest and before sending the creative brief, send the following:

**YOU:**

> Before we move forward, I want to be fully transparent about my creative process — I share this with every client upfront, and Reedsy requires it.
>
> My illustration workflow uses **AI-assisted image generation** as a core part of the creative pipeline. I use advanced prompt engineering techniques to generate high-quality visual concepts for your illustrations and cover art, which I then refine, composite, color-grade, and finalize into production-ready artwork.
>
> **What this means in practice:**
>
> - I translate your creative brief — characters, scenes, mood, and art style — into detailed image generation prompts, each one carefully engineered to capture your story's world and characters
> - Each illustration goes through multiple rounds of generation, selection, and refinement — I generate dozens of variations and curate the strongest results
> - I ensure character consistency across all illustrations so your characters look the same on every page
> - I composite, color-grade, and enhance the selected outputs to achieve a cohesive, polished visual style throughout the book
> - Typography, layout, print formatting, and final production are handled with professional design precision
> - Every deliverable is a polished, commercially ready, print-quality product — not a raw AI output
>
> **What this does NOT mean:**
>
> - This is not "type a sentence and use the first thing that appears." Every illustration goes through an extensive creative process driven by my expertise in visual storytelling, children's book conventions, and publishing requirements.
> - I've published 22 books across 3 series on Amazon — all designed using this exact pipeline. The quality and consistency speak for themselves.
>
> **Please take a look at my portfolio to see the quality this process delivers:**
>
> - https://metronagon.com/ai-transparency — full details on my AI-assisted process, copyright protections, and a real example prompt
> - https://metronagon.com/examples — cover gallery across multiple genres
> - https://metronagon.com/case-studies — complete series case studies showing visual consistency across multiple books
>
> Per Reedsy's AI transparency policy, I need your written confirmation that you're comfortable with AI-assisted tools being part of the creative process before we proceed.
>
> Happy to answer any questions about how it works.

### Client Response: Accepts

**CLIENT:**

> That's totally fine with me. Your portfolio looks great — let's go!

**YOU:**

> Thank you — I appreciate both the trust and the chance to bring your story to life. I'll note your consent in our project record and send you the creative brief next.

---

### Client Response: Has Questions About Quality / Style Consistency

**CLIENT:**

> I'm open to it, but children's books are very visual — I need the illustrations to feel warm and hand-crafted, not "AI-looking." Can you guarantee that?

**YOU:**

> Completely fair concern, and especially important for children's books where the art IS the experience. Here's how I deliver that warmth and quality:
>
> 1. **Your brief drives every prompt.** I don't use templates or generic inputs. Every illustration prompt is custom-built from YOUR specific characters, scenes, color palette, and art style direction.
> 2. **Character consistency.** This is critical for children's books — your main character needs to look the same on every page. I engineer prompts that maintain consistent character design, proportions, and style throughout.
> 3. **Iterative refinement.** I generate dozens of variations per illustration, then select, composite, and refine the strongest elements — it's a curation and design process, not a one-shot output.
> 4. **Art style matching.** Whether you want watercolor, digital painting, cartoon, whimsical, or storybook — I dial in the style through my prompts and maintain it across every illustration.
> 5. **Professional finishing.** Color grading, composition, and production polish are all applied with the care that children's books demand.
>
> Check my portfolio for proof: https://metronagon.com/case-studies — you'll see the level of visual consistency I maintain across entire series.
>
> If you're comfortable, just confirm and I'll send the creative brief!

---

### Client Response: Has Copyright Concerns

**CLIENT:**

> I've read that AI-generated images can't be copyrighted. Will that be a problem for my children's book?

**YOU:**

> Important question — and one I take very seriously as a professional.
>
> You're right that the US Copyright Office has indicated that purely AI-generated images with minimal human input may lack full copyright protection on their own. However, my workflow involves substantial human creative direction at every stage: concept development, detailed prompt engineering, visual selection, compositing, refinement, layout, and production design.
>
> The final illustrations you receive are not raw AI outputs — they're professionally designed artwork that reflects significant human creative decision-making throughout the entire process.
>
> As a Reedsy professional, I bear full legal responsibility for ensuring that your deliverables are commercially exploitable and free of copyright issues. That's my obligation to you, and I stand behind it completely.
>
> You'll receive production-ready files that you can use commercially on Amazon, IngramSpark, or any other publishing platform without restriction.

---

### Client Response: Declines AI-Assisted Work

**CLIENT:**

> I appreciate the honesty, but I'd prefer a hand-drawn illustrator for my children's book. Nothing personal.

**YOU:**

> No offense taken at all — I genuinely respect that preference, especially for children's books where many authors have a specific vision for the art style. I'd always rather be upfront than surprise you later.
>
> I'd suggest browsing Reedsy's other illustrators who specialize in traditional illustration or hand-drawn digital art. If you ever want to see what my pipeline can deliver, my portfolio is always open: https://metronagon.com/examples
>
> Best of luck with your book — I hope it becomes a bedtime favorite!

---

## Phase 2: Creative Brief Request

**YOU:**

> Here's the creative brief for your Plus picture book. This package includes print formatting, so I need a few extra details about the physical book.
>

## Phase 3: Receiving the Brief

### Scenario A: Complete Brief

**CLIENT:**

> Title: "Zara's Brave Day"
> Author: Priya Sharma
> Age group: 3-5
> Concept: Zara is a shy 4-year-old starting preschool for the first time. Everything seems scary until she realizes the other kids feel the same way. She makes her first friend by being brave enough to say "hi."
>
> Main character: Zara — 4 years old, dark brown skin, curly black hair in two puffs, big brown eyes, wears a yellow dress with a ladybug pin (her "brave pin"), carries a small stuffed elephant named Ellie
> Supporting characters: Mom (warm, wears a blue headscarf), Teacher Ms. Chen (kind, glasses, gray hair in a bun), Leo (new friend — shy, freckles, red hair, dinosaur backpack)
> Setting: Home (warm, cozy), car ride, preschool entrance (big and intimidating), classroom (colorful, eventually welcoming)
> Tone: Gentle, reassuring, warm
> Lesson: Being brave doesn't mean not being scared — it means doing it anyway
> Emotional arc: Scared → uncertain → discovers others feel the same → brave → happy
> Style: Pixar/Disney-inspired, warm and bright
> Colors: Warm yellows (Zara's color), soft blues (calming), bright classroom colors
> References: "The Invisible String," "Llama Llama Misses Mama" — that gentle, reassuring style
> Text: 1-2 sentences per page
> No-text pages: A few full-bleed pages at key emotional moments
> Text placement: Below illustrations
> Trim: 8.5" x 8.5" square
> Print: KDP Print Paperback
> Dedication: "For every brave little heart taking their first big step"
> Back cover: "Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is say 'hi.'" with a small illustration of Zara and Leo
> Special: Zara's ladybug pin should be visible on every page she appears
>
> [Attaches 32-page story text]

**YOU:**

> Priya, this is a wonderful story — "Zara's Brave Day" is going to resonate with so many families. The character details are perfect. Here's my plan:
>
> **Character Design:**
>
> - Zara: Dark brown skin, curly black hair in two puffs, big expressive brown eyes, yellow dress, ladybug pin (visible on every page), stuffed elephant Ellie. Body language progresses: hunched/shy early → standing tall later.
> - Mom: Warm presence, blue headscarf, appears in home/car scenes. Reassuring body language.
> - Ms. Chen: Kind authority figure, glasses, gray bun. Welcoming gestures.
> - Leo: Shy mirror to Zara — freckles, red hair, dinosaur backpack. His own shy-to-brave arc.
>
> **Art Direction:**
>
> - Pixar/Disney-inspired with warm, bright lighting
> - Color progression: Muted/cool when Zara is scared → warm/bright as she gains confidence
> - Home scenes: Cozy yellows and warm amber
> - Preschool entrance: Slightly oversized/intimidating perspective (from Zara's height)
> - Classroom: Bursting with color once Zara feels welcome
> - The ladybug pin is a constant anchor across every illustration
>
> **Print Specs:**
>
> - 8.5" x 8.5" square, KDP Print Paperback
> - Full bleed, proper margins and gutter
> - Text positioned below illustrations
> - Full-bleed pages at key emotional moments (the scary entrance, the brave "hi," the happy ending)
>
> **Back Cover:**
>
> - Tagline: "Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is say 'hi.'"
> - Small illustration: Zara and Leo sitting together, smiling
>
> I'll deliver all 32 pages + front cover + back cover + print-ready PDF within 2 business days. Starting now!

---

### Scenario B: Client Unsure About Back Cover

**CLIENT:**

> I don't know what to put on the back cover. Any suggestions?

**YOU:**

> For children's picture books, the back cover typically has:
>
> 1. **A tagline or hook** — 1-2 sentences that capture the book's heart. Examples:
>
>    - "Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is say 'hi.'"
>    - "What happens when a shy little girl discovers that everyone feels a little scared?"
>
> 2. **A small illustration** — A cute scene from the book or a character moment that doesn't give away the ending.
>
> 3. **Barcode area** — Amazon handles this automatically through Cover Creator, but I'll leave the proper space for it.
>
> I can create the back cover with a tagline and illustration that complements the front. Just tell me the general idea (or say "your call") and I'll design something fitting.

---

## Phase 4: Illustration Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi Priya! "Zara's Brave Day" is fully illustrated. Here's everything:
>
> **Front Cover** > [Image attached]
> Zara standing at the preschool entrance, clutching Ellie, ladybug pin gleaming on her yellow dress. The door ahead is slightly open, warm light spilling out. She looks nervous but determined.
>
> **Back Cover** > [Image attached]
> "Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is say 'hi.'" Zara and Leo sitting cross-legged together, both smiling, Ellie between them. Dinosaur backpack visible. Soft, warm background. Barcode area reserved in the lower right.
>
> **Sample Pages:**
>
> **Page 1** — Zara at home, clinging to Mom's leg, looking up nervously. Warm amber lighting, cozy kitchen. Ellie tucked under her arm.
> [Image attached]
>
> **Page 12** — The preschool entrance from Zara's perspective — the doors look enormous, the hallway stretches far. Cool, slightly intimidating palette. Other kids are blurry shapes ahead.
> [Image attached]
>
> **Page 20** — Full-bleed page. Zara notices Leo sitting alone, looking just as scared. Their eyes meet. Warm and cool colors merging.
> [Image attached]
>
> **Page 32** — Final page. Zara running ahead of Mom to the preschool entrance the next morning, waving at Leo who's waiting by the door. Bright, warm, joyful. Yellow dress practically glowing.
> [Image attached]
>
> **Complete delivery:**
>
> - Print-ready PDF (8.5" x 8.5", bleed, margins, gutter — KDP Print ready)
> - Front cover PNG/JPG
> - Back cover PNG/JPG
> - All 32 page illustrations as individual PNGs
>
> **What to do next:**
>
> 1. Review all pages, front cover, and back cover
> 2. Check: character consistency, text readability, emotional arc, ladybug pin visibility
> 3. List ALL changes in one message — this is Revision Round 1 of 2
>
> Take your time reviewing!

---

## Phase 5: Revision Round 1

### Scenario A: Print-Specific Feedback

**CLIENT:**

> The illustrations are gorgeous! A few things:
>
> - The text on pages 7 and 15 is too close to the edge — will it get cut off in print?
> - Page 22: Zara's ladybug pin isn't visible
> - Back cover: Can the illustration be a tiny bit larger?
> - Everything else is perfect

**YOU:**

> Great catches, especially the margin issue. I'll fix all three:
>
> 1. Pages 7 and 15 — Move text inward from the edge to safe zone (well within the margin/gutter area so nothing gets trimmed)
> 2. Page 22 — Add the ladybug pin to Zara's dress (consistency fix)
> 3. Back cover — Scale up the illustration slightly for more visual impact
>
> I'll also do a full margin check across all 32 pages to ensure no text or critical elements are in the bleed zone. This is Revision Round 1 of 2.

---

### Scenario B: Emotional Tone Feedback

**CLIENT:**

> The art is beautiful but some of the "scary" pages feel too scary for a 3-year-old. Can you soften the preschool entrance and the classroom scenes?

**YOU:**

> Absolutely — great instinct. For ages 3-5, the emotional threshold is lower. I'll soften:
>
> - **Preschool entrance:** Less oversized/intimidating perspective. Still big from Zara's view, but warmer lighting, more welcoming colors peeking through the door.
> - **Classroom:** Brighter even in the initial "scary" moment. Other kids' faces more friendly, less blurry.
> - **Overall:** Dial back any shadows that feel ominous. Keep the "nervous" feeling through Zara's body language and expression rather than through environmental darkness.
>
> The emotional arc will still work — just gentler. This is Revision Round 1 of 2.

---

## Phase 6: Revision Round 2

### Scenario A: Final Fine-Tuning

**CLIENT:**

> Round 1 is great. Two small things:
>
> - Can you make Zara's hair puffs slightly bigger? They're her signature look.
> - The dedication page font feels too formal — can it be more playful?

**YOU:**

> Easy fixes:
>
> 1. Zara's hair puffs — Slightly larger and more defined across all pages where she appears
> 2. Dedication font — Switch to a warmer, more playful typeface that matches the book's tone
>
> This is Round 2 of 2 (your final included round). I'll apply these and do a final print-ready check before preparing delivery files.

---

## Phase 7: Final Delivery

**YOU:**

> Hi Priya! "Zara's Brave Day" is finalized and print-ready!
>
> **Final Delivery:**
>
> **Print-Ready PDF:**
>
> - `Zaras-Brave-Day-PRINT-READY.pdf` — 8.5" x 8.5", full bleed, proper margins and gutter. Ready for KDP Print upload.
>
> **Covers:**
>
> - `Zaras-Brave-Day-Front-Cover.png / .jpg`
> - `Zaras-Brave-Day-Back-Cover.png / .jpg`
>
> **Individual Page Files:**
>
> - `Page-01.png` through `Page-32.png`
>
> **Files delivered via:** Google Drive link (organized: /PrintPDF, /Covers, /Pages)
>
> **How to publish on KDP Print:**
>
> 1. Go to KDP → Create Paperback
> 2. Upload the print-ready PDF as your interior file
> 3. For the cover: use Amazon's Cover Creator and upload the front cover + back cover images, or upload as a full wrap if you combine them with the spine
> 4. Amazon will generate the spine from the page count
> 5. Preview carefully in KDP's online previewer before publishing
>
> **Also works for:**
>
> - **Kindle Kids:** Upload the PDF directly as the ebook file
> - **Marketing:** Use individual page images for social media, Amazon A+ content, etc.
>
> Please do a final review of the print PDF — check margins, text safety, and page order.
>
> "Zara's Brave Day" is a book that's going to mean a lot to a lot of little kids and their parents. Thank you for trusting me with it. A Reedsy review would be wonderful — and returning clients always get 10% off!

---

## Phase 8: Post-Delivery Scenarios

### Scenario A: Client Wants a Hardcover Edition

**CLIENT:**

> The paperback is selling well! Can you make a hardcover version?

**YOU:**

> The illustrations and content are the same — the difference is in the print specifications. For hardcover on KDP, the trim size and formatting requirements differ slightly.
>
> I can reformat the print-ready PDF for KDP Print Hardcover specifications for $35 (Book Description Update pricing — since it's a formatting adjustment, not new art).
>
> Want me to proceed? Just confirm whether you want the same trim size or a different one for hardcover.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants a Sequel

**CLIENT:**

> We're doing a sequel — "Zara's Show and Tell"! Same character, new story.

**YOU:**

> Wonderful! Since Zara's character design is already locked in, the sequel will be seamless — same look, same ladybug pin, same warmth.
>
> Same Plus package at $700. Returning client discount: **$630** (10% off).
>
> Send me the story text and brief whenever you're ready!

---

### Scenario C: Client Wants Additional Pages

**CLIENT:**

> My editor thinks the story needs 4 more pages — so 36 total instead of 32. Can you add them?

**YOU:**

> Of course! Additional pages are $50/page (Children's Book — Add Page). For 4 extra pages: $200.
>
> Send me the text for the 4 new pages and where they should be inserted in the story, and I'll illustrate them in the same style and integrate them into the print-ready PDF.
>
> Total: $200 for 4 additional illustrated pages. 1 day per page delivery.
