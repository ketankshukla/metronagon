## Phase 1: Initial Inquiry

### Scenario A: Client Wants a Print Paperback

**CLIENT:**
> Hi, I want to create a children's picture book and publish it as a paperback on Amazon. What do you offer?

**YOU:**
> Hi! For a print paperback, my Plus package ($700) is the right fit. It includes everything you need for KDP Print:
>
> - 32 fully illustrated pages with consistent character design
> - Front AND back cover illustrations (no spine — Amazon's Cover Creator handles that)
> - Print-ready PDF formatted to KDP Print specifications (bleed, margins, gutter)
> - All page illustrations as individual high-res files
> - 2 rounds of revisions
> - 2 business day delivery
>
> The key difference between Plus and Standard is that Plus gives you the **back cover**, **print-ready formatting**, and **an extra revision round** — all essential for a physical paperback.
>
> You provide the story text, and I create all the artwork. Do you have your story written? I can send you the creative brief to get started.

### Scenario B: Client Comparing Standard vs Plus

**CLIENT:**
> What's the difference between Standard ($500) and Plus ($700)?

**YOU:**
> Here's the comparison:
>
> | Feature | Standard ($500) | Plus ($700) |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | 32 illustrated pages | Yes | Yes (enhanced quality) |
> | Character consistency | Yes | Yes |
> | Front cover | Yes | Yes |
> | Back cover | No | **Yes** |
> | PDF format | Digital-ready | **Print-ready (KDP Print specs)** |
> | Individual page files | Yes | Yes |
> | Revision rounds | 1 | **2** |
> | Delivery | 2 days | 2 days |
>
> **Bottom line:**
> - **Standard** = Kindle Kids / digital only. Front cover only.
> - **Plus** = Print paperback on Amazon. Front + back covers. Print-ready formatting.
>
> If you're doing a physical paperback, Plus is the package you need. If it's digital-only (Kindle Kids), Standard covers everything.
>
> Which are you planning?

---

### Scenario C: Client Upgrading From Standard

**CLIENT:**
> I bought the Standard package last month and now I want to do a paperback. Can I upgrade to Plus?

**YOU:**
> Absolutely! Since you already have the Standard deliverables, the upgrade to Plus adds:
> - Back cover illustration
> - Print-ready PDF reformatted for KDP Print (bleed, margins, gutter)
> - 1 additional revision round
>
> The upgrade cost is $200 (the difference between Standard and Plus). I'll use your existing illustrations and add the print-specific elements.
>
> Want to proceed? I just need your back cover preferences (any text, tagline, or specific imagery you'd like on the back).

---

### Scenario D: Client Asks About Trim Size

**CLIENT:**
> What size will the book be? I want it to be a specific size.

**YOU:**
> I can format to any standard KDP Print trim size. The most common for picture books are:
>
> - **8.5" x 8.5" (square)** — The classic picture book format. Most popular for ages 2-6.
> - **8" x 10" (portrait)** — Taller format, works well for character-focused stories.
> - **10" x 8" (landscape)** — Wider format, great for panoramic scenes and environments.
>
> The square format is my default recommendation — it's what most readers expect for a children's picture book. But I'll format to whatever size you prefer.
>
> Which do you want? If you're unsure, go with 8.5" x 8.5" square.

---

## Phase 2: Creative Brief Request

**YOU:**
> Here's the creative brief for your Plus picture book. This package includes print formatting, so I need a few extra details about the physical book.
>
> **CREATIVE BRIEF — Children's Picture Book (Plus)**
>
> **1. Story Details**
> - Do you have a story written already? If yes, please attach it:

## Phase 3: Receiving the Brief

### Scenario A: Complete Brief

**CLIENT:**
> Title: "Zara's Brave Day"
> Author: Priya Sharma
> Age group: 3-5
> Concept: Zara is a shy 4-year-old starting preschool for the first time. Everything seems scary until she realizes the other kids feel the same way. She makes her first friend by being brave enough to say "hi."
>
> Main character: Zara — 4 years old, dark brown skin, curly black hair in two puffs, big brown eyes, wears a yellow dress with a ladybug pin (her "brave pin"), carries a small stuffed elephant named Ellie
> Supporting characters: Mom (warm, wears a blue headscarf), Teacher Ms. Chen (kind, glasses, gray hair in a bun), Leo (new friend — shy, freckles, red hair, dinosaur backpack)
> Setting: Home (warm, cozy), car ride, preschool entrance (big and intimidating), classroom (colorful, eventually welcoming)
> Tone: Gentle, reassuring, warm
> Lesson: Being brave doesn't mean not being scared — it means doing it anyway
> Emotional arc: Scared → uncertain → discovers others feel the same → brave → happy
> Style: Pixar/Disney-inspired, warm and bright
> Colors: Warm yellows (Zara's color), soft blues (calming), bright classroom colors
> References: "The Invisible String," "Llama Llama Misses Mama" — that gentle, reassuring style
> Text: 1-2 sentences per page
> No-text pages: A few full-bleed pages at key emotional moments
> Text placement: Below illustrations
> Trim: 8.5" x 8.5" square
> Print: KDP Print Paperback
> Dedication: "For every brave little heart taking their first big step"
> Back cover: "Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is say 'hi.'" with a small illustration of Zara and Leo
> Special: Zara's ladybug pin should be visible on every page she appears
>
> [Attaches 32-page story text]

**YOU:**
> Priya, this is a wonderful story — "Zara's Brave Day" is going to resonate with so many families. The character details are perfect. Here's my plan:
>
> **Character Design:**
> - Zara: Dark brown skin, curly black hair in two puffs, big expressive brown eyes, yellow dress, ladybug pin (visible on every page), stuffed elephant Ellie. Body language progresses: hunched/shy early → standing tall later.
> - Mom: Warm presence, blue headscarf, appears in home/car scenes. Reassuring body language.
> - Ms. Chen: Kind authority figure, glasses, gray bun. Welcoming gestures.
> - Leo: Shy mirror to Zara — freckles, red hair, dinosaur backpack. His own shy-to-brave arc.
>
> **Art Direction:**
> - Pixar/Disney-inspired with warm, bright lighting
> - Color progression: Muted/cool when Zara is scared → warm/bright as she gains confidence
> - Home scenes: Cozy yellows and warm amber
> - Preschool entrance: Slightly oversized/intimidating perspective (from Zara's height)
> - Classroom: Bursting with color once Zara feels welcome
> - The ladybug pin is a constant anchor across every illustration
>
> **Print Specs:**
> - 8.5" x 8.5" square, KDP Print Paperback
> - Full bleed, proper margins and gutter
> - Text positioned below illustrations
> - Full-bleed pages at key emotional moments (the scary entrance, the brave "hi," the happy ending)
>
> **Back Cover:**
> - Tagline: "Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is say 'hi.'"
> - Small illustration: Zara and Leo sitting together, smiling
>
> I'll deliver all 32 pages + front cover + back cover + print-ready PDF within 2 business days. Starting now!

---

### Scenario B: Client Unsure About Back Cover

**CLIENT:**
> I don't know what to put on the back cover. Any suggestions?

**YOU:**
> For children's picture books, the back cover typically has:
>
> 1. **A tagline or hook** — 1-2 sentences that capture the book's heart. Examples:
>    - "Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is say 'hi.'"
>    - "What happens when a shy little girl discovers that everyone feels a little scared?"
>
> 2. **A small illustration** — A cute scene from the book or a character moment that doesn't give away the ending.
>
> 3. **Barcode area** — Amazon handles this automatically through Cover Creator, but I'll leave the proper space for it.
>
> I can create the back cover with a tagline and illustration that complements the front. Just tell me the general idea (or say "your call") and I'll design something fitting.

## Phase 4: Illustration Delivery

**YOU:**
> Hi Priya! "Zara's Brave Day" is fully illustrated. Here's everything:
>
> **Front Cover**
> [Image attached]
> Zara standing at the preschool entrance, clutching Ellie, ladybug pin gleaming on her yellow dress. The door ahead is slightly open, warm light spilling out. She looks nervous but determined.
>
> **Back Cover**
> [Image attached]
> "Sometimes the bravest thing you can do is say 'hi.'" Zara and Leo sitting cross-legged together, both smiling, Ellie between them. Dinosaur backpack visible. Soft, warm background. Barcode area reserved in the lower right.
>
> **Sample Pages:**
>
> **Page 1** — Zara at home, clinging to Mom's leg, looking up nervously. Warm amber lighting, cozy kitchen. Ellie tucked under her arm.
> [Image attached]
>
> **Page 12** — The preschool entrance from Zara's perspective — the doors look enormous, the hallway stretches far. Cool, slightly intimidating palette. Other kids are blurry shapes ahead.
> [Image attached]
>
> **Page 20** — Full-bleed page. Zara notices Leo sitting alone, looking just as scared. Their eyes meet. Warm and cool colors merging.
> [Image attached]
>
> **Page 32** — Final page. Zara running ahead of Mom to the preschool entrance the next morning, waving at Leo who's waiting by the door. Bright, warm, joyful. Yellow dress practically glowing.

> - Front cover PNG/JPG
> - Back cover PNG/JPG
> - All 32 page illustrations as individual PNGs

> **What to do next:**
> 1. Review all pages, front cover, and back cover
> 2. Check: character consistency, text readability, emotional arc, ladybug pin visibility
> 3. List ALL changes in one message — this is Revision Round 1 of 2
>
> Take your time reviewing!

---

## Phase 5: Revision Round 1

### Scenario A: Print-Specific Feedback

**CLIENT:**
> The illustrations are gorgeous! A few things:
> - The text on pages 7 and 15 is too close to the edge — will it get cut off in print?
> - Page 22: Zara's ladybug pin isn't visible
> - Back cover: Can the illustration be a tiny bit larger?
> - Everything else is perfect

**YOU:**
> Great catches, especially the margin issue. I'll fix all three:
> 1. Pages 7 and 15 — Move text inward from the edge to safe zone (well within the margin/gutter area so nothing gets trimmed)
> 2. Page 22 — Add the ladybug pin to Zara's dress (consistency fix)
> 3. Back cover — Scale up the illustration slightly for more visual impact
>
> I'll also do a full margin check across all 32 pages to ensure no text or critical elements are in the bleed zone. This is Revision Round 1 of 2.

---

### Scenario B: Emotional Tone Feedback

**CLIENT:**
> The art is beautiful but some of the "scary" pages feel too scary for a 3-year-old. Can you soften the preschool entrance and the classroom scenes?

**YOU:**
> Absolutely — great instinct. For ages 3-5, the emotional threshold is lower. I'll soften:
>
> - **Preschool entrance:** Less oversized/intimidating perspective. Still big from Zara's view, but warmer lighting, more welcoming colors peeking through the door.
> - **Classroom:** Brighter even in the initial "scary" moment. Other kids' faces more friendly, less blurry.
> - **Overall:** Dial back any shadows that feel ominous. Keep the "nervous" feeling through Zara's body language and expression rather than through environmental darkness.
>
> The emotional arc will still work — just gentler. This is Revision Round 1 of 2.

---

## Phase 6: Revision Round 2

### Scenario A: Final Fine-Tuning

**CLIENT:**
> Round 1 is great. Two small things:
> - Can you make Zara's hair puffs slightly bigger? They're her signature look.
> - The dedication page font feels too formal — can it be more playful?

**YOU:**
> Easy fixes:
> 1. Zara's hair puffs — Slightly larger and more defined across all pages where she appears
> 2. Dedication font — Switch to a warmer, more playful typeface that matches the book's tone
>
> This is Round 2 of 2 (your final included round). I'll apply these and do a final print-ready check before preparing delivery files.

---

## Phase 7: Final Delivery

**YOU:**
> Hi Priya! "Zara's Brave Day" is finalized and print-ready!
>
> **Final Delivery:**

## Phase 8: Post-Delivery Scenarios

### Scenario A: Client Wants a Hardcover Edition

**CLIENT:**
> The paperback is selling well! Can you make a hardcover version?

**YOU:**
> The illustrations and content are the same — the difference is in the print specifications. For hardcover on KDP, the trim size and formatting requirements differ slightly.
>
> I can reformat the print-ready PDF for KDP Print Hardcover specifications for $35 (Book Description Update pricing — since it's a formatting adjustment, not new art).
>
> Want me to proceed? Just confirm whether you want the same trim size or a different one for hardcover.

---

### Scenario B: Client Wants a Sequel

**CLIENT:**
> We're doing a sequel — "Zara's Show and Tell"! Same character, new story.

**YOU:**
> Wonderful! Since Zara's character design is already locked in, the sequel will be seamless — same look, same ladybug pin, same warmth.
>
> Same Plus package at $700. Returning client discount: **$630** (10% off).
>
> Send me the story text and brief whenever you're ready!

---

### Scenario C: Client Wants Additional Pages

**CLIENT:**
> My editor thinks the story needs 4 more pages — so 36 total instead of 32. Can you add them?

**YOU:**
> Of course! Additional pages are $50/page (Children's Book — Add Page). For 4 extra pages: $200.
>
> Send me the text for the 4 new pages and where they should be inserted in the story, and I'll illustrate them in the same style and integrate them into the print-ready PDF.
>
> Total: $200 for 4 additional illustrated pages. 1 day per page delivery.
