## 6. Profile Picture

Use your Metronagon pentagon logo: `public/portfolio/logo.png`

Upload at **400 × 400 px** minimum. The gold pentagon on dark background renders perfectly as a circular avatar — the corners will be cropped but the pentagon shape remains clear and iconic.

---

## 7. Header / Banner Image (1500 × 500 px)

Use the same banner concept as YouTube but cropped to 1500 × 500 px. See `youtube-banner-prompt.md` for the AI generation prompts. For X specifically, use this adapted prompt:

```
Wide cinematic banner (1500x500), dark charcoal-black background, gold (#d4af37) accents. Left: dramatic fantasy book covers fanning outward with gold rim lighting. Center-right: colorful children's book illustration pages alongside a row of branded book covers. Subtle gold particle dust, dark vignette edges. Premium, luxurious, professional book design studio aesthetic. Photorealistic, studio lighting. --ar 3:1
```

After generating, overlay text in Canva:

- **"METRONAGON MEDIA"** — centered, Playfair Display or Cinzel font, gold
- **"Book Covers · Series Branding · Children's Books"** — smaller, below, white or light gold
- **"metronagon.com"** — bottom-right corner, small, muted gold

## 12. Posting Strategy

### Frequency

- **Minimum:** 1 post per day
- **Ideal:** 2–3 posts per day (morning, afternoon, evening)
- **Best times for indie author audience:** 8–9 AM EST, 12–1 PM EST, 7–9 PM EST

### Content Mix (weekly)

| Day       | Content Type               | Example                                          |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Monday    | Cover reveal / showcase    | Post a finished cover with process details       |
| Tuesday   | Educational tip            | "3 things that make a fantasy cover sell"        |
| Wednesday | Before/after or comparison | Side-by-side of concept vs. final                |
| Thursday  | Portfolio highlight        | Showcase a full series branding project          |
| Friday    | Behind the scenes          | Work-in-progress screenshot                      |
| Saturday  | Engagement post            | Poll: "Which cover style do you prefer? A or B?" |
| Sunday    | Promotional                | Direct CTA to services page with pricing         |

### Hashtag Strategy

Use 3–5 hashtags per post (X's sweet spot — more than that looks spammy):

**Primary hashtags (rotate these):**

```
#BookCoverDesign #IndieAuthor #SelfPublishing #BookCovers #WritingCommunity
#AuthorLife #KDP #AmazonKDP #BookDesign #CoverDesign
#BookCoverReveal #BookTwitter #WritersOfTwitter #AmWriting
#ChildrensBooks #PictureBook #BookIllustration
#SeriesBranding #BookMarketing #AuthorBranding
#FantasyBooks #SciFiBooks #RomanceBooks #ThrillerBooks
#BookCoverArt #EbookCover #BookStagram #AIart
```

**Always include:** `#BookCoverDesign` and either `#IndieAuthor` or `#SelfPublishing`

| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Indie author influencers             | @JoannaPenn, @MarkDawsonAuth, @NickStephensonA | Their followers are your customers   |
| Self-publishing educators            | @DaleRoberts\_, @kindlepreneur                 | Same audience                        |

### Engagement Tactics

1. **Reply to indie authors asking about cover design** — search "need book cover" or "looking for cover designer" daily
2. **Quote-tweet author cover reveals** with professional commentary ("Love the color contrast here — the gold title really pops against the dark background")
3. **Reply to writing community threads** with helpful design advice
4. **Run weekly polls** — "Which genre is hardest to design covers for?" (engagement magnets)
5. **Celebrate client work** — "Just delivered this [genre] cover for an amazing author" (with permission)

---

## 14. Thread Ideas (Long-Form Content)

Threads get 2–3x more engagement than single tweets. Publish one thread per week:

1. **"I designed 12 book covers for one series. Here's every cover and the story behind each one."** (Aztec Chronicles showcase)
2. **"5 book cover mistakes that are killing your sales — and exactly how to fix each one."**
3. **"What goes into a $1,400 series branding package? Here's everything you get."** (service breakdown)
4. **"I illustrated a complete 32-page children's book. Here's the full process."**
5. **"The anatomy of a bestselling fantasy book cover — a designer's breakdown."**
6. **"How to brief a book cover designer so you get exactly what you want (a thread for authors)."**
7. **"3 cover designs, 1 winner. Here's how I present concepts to clients and how we choose the final."**
8. **"Before I was Metronagon Media — my design journey and how I got here."** (personal story, builds connection)

## 15. Alt Text Templates

Always add alt text to images (accessibility + search discovery):

**For single covers:**

```
Professional [genre] ebook cover design featuring [brief description of the cover image]. Designed by Metronagon Media. [dimensions] at 300 DPI.
```

**For series:**

```
